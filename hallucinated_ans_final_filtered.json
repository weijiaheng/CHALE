Nashville 's pop song structure became more pronounced and it morphed into what was called Countrypolitan - a smoother sound typified through the use of lush string arrangements with a real orchestra and often , background vocals provided by a choir . Countrypolitan was aimed straight at mainstream markets and it sold well throughout the later 1960s into the early 1970s . Among the architects of this sound were producers Billy Sherrill ( who was instrumental in shaping Tammy Wynette 's early career ) and Glenn Sutton . Artists who typified the countrypolitan sound initially included Wynette , Glen Campbell ( who recorded in Hollywood and not Nashville ) , Lynn Anderson , Charlie Rich , and Charley Pride , the latter being a rare example of a top - selling African - American country performer . </P>", "<P> Typically , a driver operating with a learner 's permit must be accompanied by an adult licensed driver who is at least 21 years of age or older and in the passenger seat of the vehicle at all times . </P>", "<P> Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k of Slovakia has been elected as the United Nations General Assembly President of its 72nd session beginning in September 2017 . </P>", "<P> Dubai ( / du\u02d0\u02c8ba\u026a / doo - BY ; Arabic : \u062f\u0628\u064a \u200e Dubay , Gulf pronunciation : ( d\u028a\u02c8b\u0251j ) ) is the largest and most populous city in the United Arab Emirates ( UAE ) .

The central nervous system is so named because it integrates information it receives from , and coordinates and influences the activity of , all parts of the bodies of bilaterally symmetric animals -- that is , all multicellular animals except sponges and radially symmetric animals such as jellyfish -- and it contains the majority of the nervous system . Many consider the retina and the optic nerve ( cranial nerve II ) , as well as the olfactory nerves ( cranial nerve I ) and olfactory epithelium as parts of the CNS , synapsing directly on brain tissue without intermediate ganglia . As such , the olfactory epithelium is the only central nervous tissue in direct contact with the environment , which opens up for therapeutic treatments . The CNS is contained within the dorsal body cavity , with the brain housed in the cranial cavity and the spinal cord in the spinal canal . In vertebrates , the brain is protected by the skull , while the spinal cord is protected by the vertebrae . The brain and spinal cord are both enclosed in the meninges . In central nervous systems , the interneuronal space is filled with a large amount of supporting non-nervous cells called neuroglial cells . </P>", "<P> The game show production team of Mark Goodson and Bill Todman was responsible for producing the original as well as the revival versions of the game show .

Synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction begins when an action potential reaches the presynaptic terminal of a motor neuron , which activates voltage - dependent calcium channels to allow calcium ions to enter the neuron . Calcium ions bind to sensor proteins ( synaptotagmin ) on synaptic vesicles , triggering vesicle fusion with the cell membrane and subsequent neurotransmitter release from the motor neuron into the synaptic cleft . In vertebrates , motor neurons release acetylcholine ( ACh ) , a small molecule neurotransmitter , which diffuses across the synaptic cleft and binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors ( nAChRs ) on the cell membrane of the muscle fiber , also known as the sarcolemma . nAChRs are ionotropic receptors , meaning they serve as ligand - gated ion channels . The binding of ACh to the receptor can depolarize the muscle fiber , causing a cascade that eventually results in muscle contraction . </P>", "<P> Torrens title is a land registration and land transfer system , in which a state creates and maintains a register of land holdings , which serves as the conclusive evidence ( termed `` indefeasibility '' ) of title of the person recorded on the register as the proprietor ( owner ) , and of all other interests recorded on the register .

At the time of the 1917 Revolution , the Russian Orthodox Church was deeply integrated into the autocratic state , enjoying official status . This was a significant factor that contributed to the Bolshevik attitude to religion and the steps they took to control it . Thus the USSR became the first state to have as one objective of its official ideology the elimination of existing religion , and the prevention of future implanting of religious belief , with the goal of establishing state atheism ( gosateizm ) . Under the doctrine of state atheism in the Soviet Union , there was a `` government - sponsored program of conversion to atheism '' conducted by Communists . The communist regime targeted religions based on State interests , and while most organized religions were never outlawed , religious property was confiscated , believers were harassed , and religion was ridiculed while atheism was propagated in schools . In 1925 the government founded the League of Militant Atheists to intensify the persecution . Accordingly , although personal expressions of religious faith were not explicitly banned , a strong sense of social stigma was imposed on them by the official structures and mass media and it was generally considered unacceptable for members of certain professions ( teachers , state bureaucrats , soldiers ) to be openly religious . </P>", "<P> `` Crazy Little Thing Called Love '' is a song by the British rock band Queen .

Myelin insulates nerve cell axons to increase the speed at which information ( encoded as an electrical signal ) travels from one nerve cell body to another ( as in the CNS ) or , for example , from a nerve cell body to a muscle ( as in the PNS ) . The myelinated axon can be likened to an electrical wire ( the axon ) with insulating material ( myelin ) around it . However , unlike the plastic covering on an electrical wire , myelin does not form a single long sheath over the entire length of the axon . Rather , each myelin sheath insulates the axon over a single section and , in general , each axon comprises multiple long myelinated sections separated from each other by short gaps . Each myelin sheath is formed by the concentric wrapping of an oligodendrocyte or Schwann cell process around the axon . </P>", "<P> `` See You Again '' is the debut single by American recording artist Miley Cyrus .

This type of bridge does not balance the forces by using a symmetrical arrangement of cable forces on each side of its support tower ; instead , it uses a cantilever tower , set at a 42 - degree angle and loaded by cable stays on only one side . This design requires that the spar resist bending and torsional forces and that its foundation resists overturning . While this leads to a less structurally efficient structure , the architectural statement is dramatic . The bridge is 700 feet ( 210 m ) in length and crosses the river without touching the water , a design criterion that helps protect the salmon spawning grounds beneath the bridge . The cable stays are not centered on the walkway but instead divide the bridge into a major and minor path . </P>", "<P> Marbury v.

They restored a church in Canterbury that dated to Roman times , possibly the present - day St Martin 's Church . \u00c6thelberht was at that time a pagan , but he allowed his wife freedom of worship . Liudhard does not appear to have made many converts among the Anglo - Saxons , and if not for the discovery of a gold coin bearing the inscription Leudardus Eps ( Eps is an abbreviation of Episcopus , the Latin word for bishop ) his existence may have been doubted .

It is sold in 355ml cans and bottles and on draught via a 30L keg . The ABV is 4.6 % . </P>", "<P> First referenced in the Code of Hammurabi , ( which predates the Hebrew bible . ) In the Hebrew Law , the `` eye for eye '' was to restrict compensation to the value of the loss . Thus , it might be better read ' only one eye for one eye ' . The biblical phrase `` an eye for an eye '' in Exodus and Leviticus ( \u05e2\u05d9\u05df \u05ea\u05d7\u05ea \u05e2\u05d9\u05df \u202c , ayin tachat ayin ) literally means ' an eye in place of an eye ' while a slightly different phrase ( \u05e2\u05b7\u05d9\u05b4\u05df \u05d1\u05b0\u05bc\u05e2\u05b7\u05d9\u05b4\u05df \u05e9\u05b5\u05c1\u05df \u05d1\u05b0\u05bc\u05e9\u05b5\u05c1\u05df , literally `` eye for an eye ; tooth for a tooth '' ) is used in another passage ( in Deuteronomy ) of the Hebrew Bible , specifically , in the first of its three subdivisions , the Torah . For example , a passage in Leviticus states , `` And a man who injures his countryman -- as he has done , so it shall be done to him ( namely , ) fracture for fracture , eye for eye , tooth for tooth . Just as he has injured a person , so it shall be done to him . '' ( Lev. 24 : 19 -- 21 ) </P>", "<P> Term limits , also referred to as rotation in office , restrict the number of terms of office an officeholder may hold . For example , according to the 22nd Amendment , the President of the United States can serve two four - year terms and serve no more than 10 years . </P>", "<P> The one - child policy , a part of the family planning policy , was a population planning policy of China . It was introduced in 1979 and began to be formally phased out near the end of 2015 and the beginning of 2016 . The policy was only enforced on Han Chinese and allowed exceptions for many groups , including ethnic minorities . In 2007 , 36 % of China 's population was subject to a strict one - child restriction , with an additional 53 % being allowed to have a second child if the first child was a girl . Provincial governments imposed fines for violations , and the local and national governments created commissions to raise awareness and carry out registration and inspection work . </P>", "<P> The 11 foot 8 Bridge ( formally known as the Norfolk Southern -- Gregson Street Overpass and nicknamed The Can - Opener ) is a railroad bridge in Durham , North Carolina , United States , that has attracted media coverage and popular attention because tall vehicles such as trucks and RVs frequently collide with the unusually low overpass , resulting in damage ranging from RV roof air conditioners being scraped off to entire truck roofs being removed . The 78 - year - old bridge along South Gregson Street provides only 11 feet 8 inches ( 3.56 m ) of vertical clearance . It can not be raised , because nearby railroad crossings would also have to be raised with it . The street also can not be lowered , because a major sewer line runs only four feet ( 1.2 m ) under Gregson Street . </P>", "<P> An Essay on Criticism is one of the first major poems written by the English writer Alexander Pope ( 1688 -- 1744 ) . It is the source of the famous quotations `` To err is human , to forgive divine '' and `` A little learning is a dang'rous thing , '' frequently misquoted as `` A little knowledge is a dang'rous thing . '' It first appeared in 1711 after having been written in 1709 , and it is clear from Pope 's correspondence that many of the poem 's ideas had existed in prose form since at least 1706 . Composed in heroic couplets ( pairs of adjacent rhyming lines of iambic pentameter ) and written in the Horatian mode of satire , it is a verse essay primarily concerned with how writers and critics behave in the new literary commerce of Pope 's contemporary age . The poem covers a range of good criticism and advice , and represents many of the chief literary ideals of Pope 's age . </P>", "<P> `` Make ' Em Laugh '' is a song first featured in the 1952 film Singin ' in the Rain , frenetically performed by Donald O'Connor . Written by Nacio Herb Brown and Arthur Freed , the song is closely based on Cole Porter 's `` Be a Clown '' . It finished at # 49 in AFI 's 100 Years ... 100 Songs survey of top tunes in American cinema . </P>", "<P> By convention , the three primary colors in additive mixing are red , green , and blue . In the absence of color , when no colors are showing , the result is black . If all three primary colors are showing , the result is white . When red and green combine , the result is yellow . When red and blue combine , the result is magenta . When blue and green combine , the result is cyan . </P>", "<P> The bank descends from the Bank of Calcutta , founded in 1806 , via the Imperial Bank of India , making it the oldest commercial bank in the Indian subcontinent . The Bank of Madras merged into the other two `` presidency banks '' in British India , the Bank of Calcutta and the Bank of Bombay , to form the Imperial Bank of India , which in turn became the State Bank of India in 1955 . The Government of India took control of the Imperial Bank of India in 1955 , with Reserve Bank of India ( India 's central bank ) taking a 60 % stake , renaming it the State Bank of India . In 2008 , the government took over the stake held by the Reserve Bank of India . </P>", "<P> `` I Ai n't Mad at Cha '' is a song by rapper 2Pac released shortly after his death as the sixth single from his album All Eyez on Me . It was also his last single using the stage name 2Pac . The song features contemporary soul singer Danny Boy who provided the vocals for the song 's hook . The song did well in the United Kingdom , reaching the number 13 on the UK Singles Chart and on the UK R&B Charts peaking at number 3 . It was not released as a single in the United States , thus making it ineligible to chart on the Billboard singles charts ( due to chart rules at the time ) , but reached numbers 18 and 58 in the R&B and Pop Airplay charts , respectively .

He is usually but not always , portrayed as living a comfortable , or even pampered life , while Jerry ( named `` Jinx '' in his debut appearance ) is a small , brown , house mouse who always lives in close proximity to Tom . Despite being very energetic , determined and much larger , Tom is no match for Jerry 's wits . Jerry also possesses surprising strength for his size , approximately the equivalent of Tom 's , lifting items such as anvils with relative ease and withstanding considerable impacts . Although cats typically chase mice to consume them , it is quite rare for Tom to actually try to consume Jerry . Most of his attempts are just to torment or humiliate Jerry , sometimes in revenge , and sometimes to obtain a reward from a human for catching Jerry . By the final `` fade - out '' of each cartoon , Jerry usually emerges triumphant , while Tom is shown as the loser . </P>", "<P> Jimmy and his friends get Dave drunk at a local bar .

A rift valley is formed on a divergent plate boundary , a crustal extension , a spreading apart of the surface , which is subsequently further deepened by the forces of erosion . When the tensional forces were strong enough to cause the plate to split apart , a center block dropped between the two blocks at its flanks , forming a graben . The drop of the center creates the nearly parallel steeply dipping walls of a rift valley when it is new . That feature is the beginning of the rift valley , but as the process continues , the valley widens , until it becomes a large basin that fills with sediment from the rift walls and the surrounding area . One of the best known examples of this process is the East African Rift . On Earth , rifts can occur at all elevations , from the sea floor to plateaus and mountain ranges in continental crust or in oceanic crust . They are often associated with a number of adjoining subsidiary or co-extensive valleys , which are typically considered part of the principal rift valley geologically . </P>", "<P> Merv Griffin conceived Wheel of Fortune just as the original version of Jeopardy ! , another show he had created , was ending its 11 - year run on NBC with Art Fleming as its host .

He and MGE 's then - president Murray Schwartz consulted an executive of Caesars Palace to find out how to build such a wheel . </P>", "<Ul> <Li> Most awards won by a single film <Ul> <Li> Three films have won 11 Academy Awards : <Ul> <Li> Ben - Hur ( 1959 ) -- 15 categories available for nomination ; nominated for 12 </Li> <Li> Titanic ( 1997 ) -- 17 categories available for nomination ; nominated for 14 </Li> <Li> The Lord of the Rings : The Return of the King ( 2003 ) -- 17 categories available for nomination ; nominated for 11 </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Most nominations received by a single film <Ul> <Li> Three films have received 14 nominations : <Ul> <Li> All About Eve ( 1950 ) -- 16 categories available for nomination ; won 6 awards </Li> <Li> Titanic ( 1997 ) -- 17 categories available for nomination ; won 11 awards </Li> <Li> La La Land ( 2016 ) -- 17 categories available for nomination ; won 6 awards </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Largest sweep ( winning awards in every nominated category ) <Ul> <Li> The Lord of the Rings : The Return of the King ( 2003 ) won all 11 categories for which it was nominated : Best Picture , Director , Adapted Screenplay , Original Score , Original Song , Sound Mixing , Art Direction , Makeup , Costume Design , Film Editing , and Visual Effects </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Most awards won by an individual <Ul> <Li> Walt Disney won 22 Oscars . </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Most awards won by a woman <Ul> <Li> Edith Head won eight Oscars , all for Costume Design </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Most nominations in a single year / Most awards in a single year <Ul> <Li> In 1954 , Walt Disney won four awards out of six nominations , both records .

It is usually used as a 10 % neutral buffered formalin ( NBF ) , that is approx . 3.7 % - 4.0 % formaldehyde in phosphate - buffered saline . Because formaldehyde is a gas at room temperature , formalin - formaldehyde gas dissolved in water ( ~ 37 % w / v ) is used when making the former fixative . Paraformaldehyde is a polymerized form of formaldehyde , usually obtained as a fine white powder , which depolymerises back to formalin when heated . Formaldehyde fixes tissue by cross-linking the proteins , primarily the residues of the basic amino acid lysine . Its effects are reversible by excess water and it avoids formalin pigmentation . Other benefits include : Long term storage and good tissue penetration . It is particularly good for immunohistochemistry techniques . Also the formaldehyde vapor can be used as a fixative for cell smears . </P>", "<P> The production team behind Full House did not want people to know that Michelle was played by a set of twins , so the girls were credited as `` Mary - Kate Ashley Olsen '' for most of the show 's run ( making it appear as if a single actress had the first name Mary - Kate and the middle name Ashley ) . Although the two were credited separately as `` Mary - Kate Olsen and Ashley Olsen '' during the closing credits in the series ' first season ( they were not officially added to the opening title sequence until season two but were credited in the syndicated versions of the season one opening titles ) , it was not until the eighth and final season that the twins were credited as `` Mary - Kate and Ashley Olsen '' in the opening titles . Despite the fact that the Olsens are fraternal twins , their physical appearances were nonetheless similar enough so that few could tell the difference between the two over the course of the show 's run . In season one , Mary - Kate was used more often due to the fact Ashley cried when she was put on set for a scene . </P>", "<P> The Capitol at Williamsburg served until the American Revolutionary War began , when Governor Thomas Jefferson urged it that the capital be relocated to Richmond .

These supports were more expensive but very firm , allowing intricately fine detail . Often printing plates from printmaking were reused for this purpose . The popularity of oil spread through Italy from the North , starting in Venice in the late 15th century . By 1540 , the previous method for painting on panel ( tempera ) had become all but extinct , although Italians continued to use chalk - based fresco for wall paintings , which was less successful and durable in damper northern climates . </P>", "<P> The show 's instrumental jazz fusion theme music , written by Jack Elliott and Allyn Ferguson , opens with a distinctive bass line performed by studio musician Chuck Berghofer .

The Young and the Restless originally aired as a half - hour series on CBS and was the first soap opera to focus on the visual aspects of production , creating `` a look that broke with the visual conventions of the genre . '' Similar to the radio serials that had preceded them , soap operas at the time primarily focused on dialogue , characters , and story , with details like sets as secondary concerns . The Young and the Restless stood out by using unique lighting techniques and camera angles , similar to Hollywood - style productions . The style of videotaping included using out - of - the - ordinary camera angles and a large number of facial close - ups with bright lighting on the actors ' faces . Conboy said he used lighting to create `` artistic effects '' . Those effects made the series look dark , shadowy , and moody . The Young and the Restless ' look influenced the taping styles of other soap operas . When H. Wesley Kenney replaced Conboy as executive producer , he balanced the lighting of the scenes . </P>", "<P> `` Do n't Leave Me This Way '' is a song written by Kenneth Gamble , Leon Huff and Cary Gilbert .

The Convention aims to prevent the spread of harmful aquatic organisms from one region to another and halt damage to the marine environment from ballast water discharge , by minimising the uptake and subsequent discharge of sediments and organisms . From 2024 all ships are required to have approved Ballast Water Management Treatment System , according to the D2 standard ( see below ) . Existing ships are required to install an approved system , which may cost up to 5 million USD per ship to install .

There are also numerous examples of marine organisms being transported in ballast water , one being the zebra mussel . Over 200 species have been introduced to the San Francisco Bay in this manner making it the most heavily invaded estuary in the world . There is also the accidental release of the Africanized honey bees ( AHB ) , known colloquially as `` killer bees '' or Africanized bee to Brazil in 1957 and the Asian carps to the United States . The insect commonly known as the brown marmorated stink bug ( Halyomorpha halys ) was introduced accidentally in Pennsylvania .

Plants that are self - sterile often inhibit the pollen grains from their own flowers from growing pollen tubes . The presence of multiple grains of pollen has been observed to stimulate quicker pollen tube growth in some plants .

Experiments have shown that beehives within 4 miles of a food source will gain weight , but beyond that the energy expended is greater than that gained during the foraging flight . Foraging at extreme distances wears out the wings of individual bees , reduces the life expectancy of foraging bees and therefore the efficiency of the colony .

This is interpreted to mean that the insurer bears the burden if there is any ambiguity in any terms of the contract . Insurance policies are sold without the policyholder even seeing a copy of the contract . In 1970 Robert Keeton suggested that many courts were actually applying ' reasonable expectations ' rather than interpreting ambiguities , which he called the ' reasonable expectations doctrine ' . This doctrine has been controversial , with some courts adopting it and others explicitly rejecting it . In several jurisdictions , including California , Wyoming , and Pennsylvania , the insured is bound by clear and conspicuous terms in the contract even if the evidence suggests that the insured did not read or understand them . </Li>", "<P> The Nile River ( Arabic : \u0627\u0644\u0646\u064a\u0644 \u200e , Egyptian Arabic en - N\u012bl , Standard Arabic an - N\u012bl ; Coptic : \u2cab\u2c93\u2c81\u2ca3\u2cb1 , P ( h ) iaro ; Ancient Egyptian : \u1e24'p\u012b and Jtrw ; Biblical Hebrew : \u05d4\u05b7\u05d9\u05b0\u05d0\u05d5\u05b9\u05e8 \u202c , Ha - Ye'or or \u05d4\u05b7\u05e9\u05b4\u05c1\u05d9\u05d7\u05d5\u05b9\u05e8 \u202c , Ha - Shi\u1e25or ) is a major north - flowing river in northeastern Africa , and is commonly regarded as the longest river in the world , though some sources cite the Amazon River as the longest .

The elytra are connected to the pterathorax ; being called as such because it is where the wings are connected ( pteron meaning `` wing '' in Greek ) . The elytra are not used for flight , but tend to cover the hind part of the body and protect the second pair of wings ( alae ) . The elytra must be raised in order to move the hind flight wings . A beetle 's flight wings are crossed with veins and are folded after landing , often along these veins , and are stored below the elytra . In some beetles , the ability to fly has been lost . These include some ground beetles ( family Carabidae ) and some `` true weevils '' ( family Curculionidae ) , but also some desert and cave - dwelling species of other families . Many of these species have the two elytra fused together , forming a solid shield over the abdomen .

Together with the cochlea , a part of the auditory system , it constitutes the labyrinth of the inner ear in most mammals . As movements consist of rotations and translations , the vestibular system comprises two components : the semicircular canals , which indicate rotational movements ; and the otoliths , which indicate linear accelerations . The vestibular system sends signals primarily to the neural structures that control eye movements , and to the muscles that keep an animal upright . The projections to the former provide the anatomical basis of the vestibulo - ocular reflex , which is required for clear vision ; and the projections to the muscles that control posture are necessary to keep an animal upright . </P>", "<P> The EU 's predecessor , the European Economic Community , was founded with the Inner Six member states in 1958 , when the Treaty of Rome came into force .

It currently fuzes about 600 million tons of hydrogen into helium every second , converting 4 million tons of matter into energy every second as a result . This energy , which can take between 10,000 and 170,000 years to escape from its core , is the source of the Sun 's light and heat . In about 5 billion years , when hydrogen fusion in its core has diminished to the point at which the Sun is no longer in hydrostatic equilibrium , the core of the Sun will experience a marked increase in density and temperature while its outer layers expand to eventually become a red giant . It is calculated that the Sun will become sufficiently large to engulf the current orbits of Mercury and Venus , and render Earth uninhabitable . After this , it will shed its outer layers and become a dense type of cooling star known as a white dwarf , which no longer produces energy by fusion , but still glows and gives off heat from its previous fusion . </P>", "<P> On April 4 , 1966 , Putnam announced a name - the - team contest .

Towards the end of the episode they 're determined not to be a threat to the aircraft , but shortly after their release Joey calls Monica and pretends that there is a gas leak in their apartment in an attempt to cover for the broken door . When Joey asked her whether they 'll charge them for the damage of breaking down the door , she sarcastically replied , `` No , I want you to stand there and wait for the entire place to blow up ! '' , causing the authorities to re-interrogate the couple . Following 9 / 11 , the writers felt the humor of this subplot was off color and quickly replaced it with a story about Chandler and Monica getting jealous over another newly married couple who got free perks by arriving just before they did .

Each episode is based around a series of cyclical events that occur along the way during Dora 's travels , along with obstacles that she and Boots are forced to overcome or puzzles that they have to solve ( with `` assistance '' from the viewing audience ) relating to riddles , the Spanish language , or counting . Common rituals may involve Dora 's encounters with Swiper , a bipedal , anthropomorphic masked thieving fox whose theft of the possessions of others must be prevented through fourth wall - breaking interaction with the viewer . To stop Swiper , Dora must say `` Swiper no swiping '' three times . However , on occasions where Swiper steals the belongings of other people , the viewer is presented with the challenge of helping Boots and Dora locate the stolen items . Another obstacle involves encounters with another one of the program 's antagonists ; the `` Grumpy Old Troll '' dwelling beneath a bridge that Dora and Boots must cross , who challenges them with a riddle before permitting them the past that needs to be solved with the viewer 's help . Known for the constant breaking of the fourth - wall depicted in every episode , the audience is usually presented to two primary landmarks that must be passed before Dora can reach her destination , normally being challenged with games or puzzles along the way .

As an actor , he also starred in the films Bled as Incubus , and The Devil 's Carnival as the hobo clown . </P>", "<P> Circulation in Jupiter 's atmosphere is markedly different from that in the atmosphere of Earth . The interior of Jupiter is fluid and lacks any solid surface . Therefore , convection may occur throughout the planet 's outer molecular envelope . As of 2008 , a comprehensive theory of the dynamics of the Jovian atmosphere has not been developed . Any such theory needs to explain the following facts : the existence of narrow stable bands and jets that are symmetric relative to Jupiter 's equator , the strong prograde jet observed at the equator , the difference between zones and belts , and the origin and persistence of large vortices such as the Great Red Spot . </P>", "<P> The longest field goal kick in NFL history is 64 yards , a record set by Matt Prater on December 8 , 2013 . The previous record was 63 , originally set by Tom Dempsey and then matched by Jason Elam , Sebastian Janikowski , and David Akers . High school , college and most professional football leagues offer only a three - point field goal ; however , some professional leagues have encouraged more rare kicks through four - point field goals . NFL Europe encouraged long field goals of 50 yards or more by making those worth four points instead of three ( much like Australian rules ' Super Goal or basketball 's three - point line ) , a rule since adopted by the Stars Football League . Similarly , the sport of arena football sought ( unsuccessfully ) to repopularize the drop kick by making that worth four points ; it failed , since only one kicker ( Brian Mitchell ) was able to do it with any semblance of proficiency . ( In six - man football , where there is no offensive line , all field goals are worth four points instead of the usual three . ) </P>", "<P> Riverdale is an American teen drama television series based on the characters by Archie Comics .

It was adapted for television by Archie Comics ' chief creative officer Roberto Aguirre - Sacasa and executive produced by Greg Berlanti .

Studies estimate that as many as 5,000 purines are lost this way each day in a typical human cell . In cells , one of the main causes of depurination is the presence of endogenous metabolites undergoing chemical reactions . Apurinic sites in double - stranded DNA are efficiently repaired by portions of the base excision repair ( BER ) pathway . Depurinated bases in single - stranded DNA undergoing replication can lead to mutations , because in the absence of information from the complementary strand , BER can add an incorrect base at the apurinic site , resulting in either a transition or transversion mutation . </P>", "<P> The Biscuits became Montgomery 's first Major League Baseball - affiliated team since 1980 , when the Montgomery Rebels , a Detroit Tigers affiliate , played their final season in the Southern League at Montgomery 's Paterson Field . The Biscuits ' owners , Sherrie Myers and Tom Dickson , were selected from six different ownership groups during an extensive search for a public - private partner by the City of Montgomery . Myers and Dickson selected the team 's nickname from over 4,000 entries in a `` name the team '' contest , due in part to tying into indigenous affiliation and potential marketing and pun possibilities ( for example , `` Hey , Butter , Butter , Butter '' or the team 's souvenir store , the `` Biscuit Basket '' ) . Several successful minor league teams have campy , quirky names to relate to families and kids . During games , biscuits are shot from an air cannon , into the stands .

Africa mainly lies within the intertropical zone between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn .

Because of this geographical situation , Africa is a hot continent as the solar radiation intensity is always high . Thus , warm and hot climates prevails all over Africa but the northern part is the most marked part by aridity and high temperatures . The climate of Africa is a range of climates such as the equatorial climate , the tropical wet and dry climate , the tropical monsoon climate , the semi-desert climate ( semi-arid ) , the desert climate ( hyper - arid and arid ) , the subtropical highland climate etc . Temperate climates remain rare through the continent except at very high elevations and along the fringes . In fact , the climate of Africa is more dependent to rainfall amount than to temperatures as they are consistently high . African deserts are the sunniest and the driest parts of the continent due to the prevailing presence of the subtropical ridge with subsiding , hot , dry air masses .

Cedar oil has an index of refraction of approximately 1.516 . The numerical aperture of cedar tree oil objectives is generally around 1.3 . Cedar oil has a number of disadvantages however : it absorbs blue and ultraviolet light , yellows with age , has sufficient acidity to potentially damage objectives with repeated use ( by attacking the cement used to join lenses ) , and diluting it with solvent changes its viscosity ( and refraction index and dispersion ) . Cedar oil must be removed from the objective immediately after use before it can harden , since removing hardened cedar oil can damage the lens . In modern microscopy synthetic immersion oils are more commonly used , as they eliminate most of these problems . NA values of 1.6 can be achieved with different oils . Unlike natural oils synthetic ones do not harden on the lens and can typically be left on the objective for months at a time . </P>", "<P> On September 18 , 2014 , Harambe was transferred to the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden to learn adult gorilla behavior and join a new social group . </P>", "<P> Conventional diesel is similar to gasoline in that it is a mixture of aliphatic hydrocarbons extracted from petroleum .

In 1934 , President Franklin Delano Roosevelt engaged Frederick Law Olmsted , Jr. to evaluate the grounds and recommend changes . Olmsted understood the need to offer presidents and their families a modicum of privacy balancing with the requirement for public views of the White House . The Olmsted plan presented the landscape largely as seen today : retaining or planting large specimen trees and shrubs on the perimeter to create boundaries for visual privacy , but punctuated with generous sight lines of the house from north and south .

Large parts of New Delhi were planned by Edwin Lutyens , who first visited Delhi in 1912 , and Herbert Baker , both leading 20th - century British architects . The contract was given to Sobha Singh . The original plan called for its construction in Tughlaqabad , inside the Tughlaqabad fort , but this was given up because of the Delhi - Calcutta trunk line that passed through the fort . Construction really began after World War I and was completed by 1931 . The city that was later dubbed `` Lutyens ' Delhi '' was inaugurated in ceremonies beginning on 10 February 1931 by Lord Irwin , the Viceroy . Lutyens designed the central administrative area of the city as a testament to Britain 's imperial aspirations . </P>", "<P> In the 1940s , B.F. Skinner delivered a series of lectures on verbal behavior , putting forth a more empirical approach to the subject than existed in psychology at the time . In them , he proposed the use of stimulus - response theories to describe language use and development , and that all verbal behavior was underpinned by operant conditioning . He did however mention that some forms of speech derived from words and sounds that had previously been heard ( echoic response ) , and that reinforcement from parents allowed these ' echoic responses ' to be pared down to that of understandable speech . While he denied that there was any `` instinct or faculty of imitation '' , Skinner 's behaviorist theories formed a basis for redevelopment into social learning theory . </P>", "<P> Thrips are small hemimetabolic insects with a distinctive cigar - shaped bauplan . They are elongated with transversely constricted bodies . They range in size from 0.5 to 14 mm ( 0.02 to 0.55 in ) in length for the larger predatory thrips , but most thrips are about 1 mm in length . Flight - capable thrips have two similar , strap - like pairs of wings with a fringe of bristles . The wings are folded back over the body at rest .

The resultant pressure buildup forces the entrance valves from the reactant storage chambers to close , thus protecting the beetle 's internal organs . The boiling , foul - smelling liquid is expelled violently through an outlet valve , with a loud popping sound . The beetles ' glands store enough hydroquinone and hydrogen peroxide to allow the beetle to release its chemical spray roughly 20 times . In some cases this is enough to kill a predator . The main component of the beetle spray is 1 , 4 - Benzoquinone , which is particularly irritating to the eyes and the respiratory system . </P>", "<P> Readers first discover why Hagrid was expelled from Hogwarts in the second novel . It is revealed that Hagrid was a student at Hogwarts at the same time as Tom Marvolo Riddle , the wizard who later became Lord Voldemort . Hagrid was expelled during his third year , after being caught in the company of Aragog , a dangerous acromantula : this already serious crime seemed worse than it was , due to the belief that the acromantula was `` The Monster of Slytherin '' , and that Hagrid had released it from the Chamber of Secrets and allowed it to attack students . Aragog escapes into the dark forest and starts a colony of spiders . The belief of Hagrid 's guilt was encouraged by Tom Riddle , the actual criminal , who had been using the true monster ( a basilisk ) to attack students , and who had framed Hagrid to prevent the school from being closed , because he did n't want to return to the orphanage whence he had come . During the events of the second book , the Basilisk is unleashed once again and Hagrid is sent to the prison of Azkaban , as he is believed again to be responsible for the attacks . However , before being arrested , Hagrid tells Harry and Ron to `` follow the spiders '' , so that they can meet Aragog and discover the identity of the true monster . After Harry defeats the Basilisk and uncovers the truth , Hagrid is freed from prison . </P>", "<P> The CT scan was introduced in the 1970s and quickly became one of the most widely used methods of imaging . A CT scan can be performed in under a second and produce rapid results for clinicians , with its ease of use leading to an increase in CT scans performed in the United States from 3 million in 1980 to 62 million in 2007 . Clinicians oftentimes take multiple scans , with 30 % of individuals undergoing at least 3 scans in one study of CT scan usage . CT scans can expose patients to levels of radiation 100 - 500 times higher than traditional x-rays , with higher radiation doses producing better resolution imaging . While easy to use , increases in CT scan use , especially in asymptomatic patients , is a topic of concern since patients are exposed to significantly high levels of radiation . </P>", "<P> The song was written by Benny Andersson and Bjorn Ulvaeus and was taken from the group 's 1979 album , Voulez - Vous .

The term coaxial comes from the inner conductor and the outer shield sharing the same geometric axis . Coaxial cables are often used as a transmission line for radio frequency signals . In a hypothetical ideal coaxial cable the electromagnetic field carrying the signal exists only in the space between the inner and outer conductors . Practical cables achieve this objective to a high degree . A coaxial cable provides extra protection of signals from external electromagnetic interference , and effectively guides signals with low emission along the length of the cable which in turn affects thermal heat inside the conductivity of the wire . </Li> <Li> Speaker wire is used to make a low - resistance electrical connection between loudspeakers and audio amplifiers .

The nucleosynthesis , or fusion of lighter elements into heavier ones , occurs during explosive oxygen burning and silicon burning processes . Those fusion reactions create the elements silicon , sulfur , chlorine , argon , sodium , potassium , calcium , scandium , titanium and iron peak elements : vanadium , chromium , manganese , iron , cobalt , and nickel . These are called `` primary elements '' , in that they can be fused from pure hydrogen and helium in massive stars . As a result of their ejection from supernovae , their abundances increase within the interstellar medium . Elements heavier than nickel are created primarily by a rapid capture of neutrons in a process called the r - process . However , these are much less abundant than the primary chemical elements . Other processes are thought to be responsible for some nucleosynthesis of other such heavy elements , notably , the proton capture process known as the rp - process and a photodisintegration process known as the gamma ( or p ) process . The latter synthesizes the lightest , most neutron - poor , isotopes of the heavy elements . </P>", "<P> Gastric acid , gastric juice or stomach acid , is a digestive fluid formed in the stomach and is composed of hydrochloric acid ( HCl ) , potassium chloride ( KCl ) and sodium chloride ( NaCl ) . The acid plays a key role in digestion of proteins , by activating digestive enzymes , and making ingested proteins unravel so that digestive enzymes break down the long chains of amino acids . Gastric acid is produced by cells in the lining of the stomach , which are coupled in feedback systems to increase acid production when needed . Other cells in the stomach produce bicarbonate , a base , to buffer the fluid , ensuring that it does not become too acidic . These cells also produce mucus , which forms a viscous physical barrier to prevent gastric acid from damaging the stomach . The pancreas further produces large amounts of bicarbonate and secretes bicarbonate through the pancreatic duct to the duodenum to completely neutralize any gastric acid that passes further down into the digestive tract . </P>", "<P> `` Drift Away '' is a song by Mentor Williams and originally recorded by John Henry Kurtz on his 1972 album Reunion .

The studio , which is also used for other television productions , was renamed the Bob Barker Studio in the host 's honor on the ceremonial 5,000 th episode taped in March 1998 . When Carey became host , there was talk of the show traveling in the future . The program is usually produced in about an hour , although if there is a guest involved , some tapings will last longer because of question and answer sessions by the audience and the guest , which the host usually moderates . Two episodes are usually taped each day , normally with three taping days per week ( Monday through Wednesday , with one episode taped at 12 : 00 pm and another at 4 : 00 pm ) . The program is taped in advance of its airdate . For example , the show broadcast on February 28 , 2008 was taped on January 16 . As with many other shows that start production in the summer , the lead time varies during the season , as many as fifteen weeks to as little as one day . The audience is entertained by the announcer before taping begins and in case of guests , the guest will answer questions from the audience . After the taping session , there is a drawing for a door prize . On some episodes , all members of the audience receive a prize from a sponsor or celebrity guest ; those prizes are usually mentioned in the Showcase ( such as a complimentary slice of Papa John 's Pizza , an NHL Winter Classic game puck , a couples ' gift box from Hershey 's or a book authored by a guest ) . Television and Internet viewers have also been directed to the show 's official website to enter a drawing for a similar prize offered to all viewers or another prize related to the special offer ( such as the Rock of Ages signed CD ) . Some episodes are taped `` out - of - order '' so that a specific episode will air after other episodes have aired . Notably , the Christmas Week episodes are usually taped in early December outside of the regular rotation . An episode may be taped out - of - order if a prize package reflects a trip to an event that is taking place close to the date that episode will air ( primarily with CBS properties such as the Academy of Country Music Awards , NCAA Men 's Division I Basketball Championship , and various NFL on CBS games , most notably CBS Super Bowl years since Carey took over , but other games are offered ) . Other episodes may be aired out - of - order because of game - related incidents or situations beyond the network 's control . Most episodes which have aired out of order have occurred when the show is taped far in advance , but in the time between the show taping and its airdate , a natural disaster took place at the trip venue . This happened in June 2005 with episodes that featured trips to New Orleans ( which was later struck by Hurricane Katrina ) , with airdates moved to May and June 2006 and again in April 2010 with episodes that featured trips to Nashville , Tennessee ( due to the May 2010 Tennessee floods ) , with airdates moved to September 2010 . </P>", "<P> More than 1,000 chemical compounds in coffee , and their molecular and physiological effects , are areas of active research in food chemistry .

The BIOS firmware comes pre-installed on a personal computer 's system board , and it is the first software run when powered on . The name originates from the Basic Input / Output System used in the CP / M operating system in 1975 . Originally proprietary to the IBM PC , the BIOS has been reverse engineered by companies looking to create compatible systems . The interface of that original system serves as a de facto standard . </P>", "<P> Over the course of the early years in their career , Girl 's Tyme changed their name to Something Fresh , Clich\u00e9 , the Dolls , and to Destiny . The group signed with Elektra Records with the name Destiny , but were dropped several months later before they could release an album . The pursuit of a record deal affected the Knowles family : in 1995 , Mathew Knowles resigned from his job as a medical - equipment salesman , a move that reduced Knowles ' family 's income by half , and her parents briefly separated due to the pressure . In 1996 , they changed their name to Destiny 's Child , which was taken from a passage in the Book of Isaiah . Mathew Knowles helped in negotiating a record deal with Columbia Records , which signed the group that same year . Prior to signing with Columbia , the group had recorded several tracks in Oakland , California produced by D'wayne Wiggins of Tony ! Toni !

Congress won 208 seats , and the Muslim League 73 . After this election , the Muslim League refused to cooperate with the Congress , and the political situation deteriorated . Hindu - Muslim riots began , and the Muslim League demanded a separate constituent assembly for Muslims in India . On 3 June 1947 Lord Mountbatten , the last British Governor - General of India , announced his intention to scrap the Cabinet Mission Plan ; this culminated in the Indian Independence Act 1947 and the separate nations of India and Pakistan . The Indian Independence Act was passed on 18 July 1947 and , although it was earlier declared that India would become independent in June 1948 , this event led to independence on 15 August 1947 . The Constituent Assembly ( elected for an undivided India ) met for the first time on 9 December 1946 , reassembling on 14 August 1947 as a sovereign body and successor to the British parliament 's authority in India . As a result of the partition , under the Mountbatten plan a separate constituent assembly was established in Pakistan on 3 June 1947 . The representatives of the areas incorporated into Pakistan ceased to be members of the Constituent Assembly of India . New elections were held for the West Punjab and East Bengal ( which became part of Pakistan , although East Bengal later seceded to become Bangladesh ) ; the membership of the Constituent Assembly was 299 after the reorganization , and it met on 31 December 1947 . </P>", "<Table> <Tr> <Th_colspan=\"2\"> Prime Minister of the Republic of Singapore ( show ) <Ul> <Li> Perdana Menteri Republik Singapura ( Malay ) </Li> <Li> \u65b0\u52a0\u5761 \u5171\u548c\u56fd \u603b\u7406 ( Chinese ) </Li> <Li> \u0b9a\u0bbf\u0b99\u0bcd\u0b95\u0baa\u0bcd\u0baa\u0bc2\u0bb0\u0bcd \u0b95\u0bc1\u0b9f\u0bbf\u0baf\u0bb0\u0b9a\u0bbf\u0ba9\u0bcd \u0baa\u0bbf\u0bb0\u0ba4\u0bae\u0bb0\u0bcd ( Tamil ) </Li> </Ul> </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"2\"> Prime Minister 's Crest </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"2\"> Incumbent Lee Hsien Loong , MP since 12 August 2004 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Style </Th> <Td> The Honourable </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Residence </Th> <Td> Sri Temasek </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Appointer </Th> <Td> President of the Republic of Singapore </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Term length </Th> <Td> 5 years or earlier , renewable .

Squier earns a writing credit for the inclusion of an interpolation of the drums from his 1980 song `` The Big Beat '' . Composed on the key of A major , `` Girl on Fire '' uses common time and is set to a `` heavy beat '' at a tempo of 93 beats per minute . Keys ' vocals range in the song over an octave from a low note of C \u266f up to a high note of E. On the main single , Keys opens the songs with the lyrics `` She got both feet on the ground and she 's burning it down . She got her head in the clouds and she 's not backing down . This girl is on fire ! '' Keys ' lyrics centre around toasting the `` achievements of women everywhere '' , particularly with the hook `` She 's just a girl and she 's on fire '' , which according to MTV 's Rob Markman is delivered with a `` calming - yet - commanding wail '' . Markman also spoke of the pace of the song , describing it as `` pulsating '' . LA Time 's Gerrick Kennedy expanded further describing the songs components as `` a fierce battlecry over a fast - building simplistic hook '' . Critics likened `` Girl on Fire '' to Keys ' previous singles `` No One '' ( 2007 ) and `` Try Sleeping with a Broken Heart '' ( 2009 ) . Throwing `` If I Ai n't Got You '' ( 2004 ) into the list of comparisons , Erin Thompson from Seattle Weekly said `` Girl on Fire '' compares to previous Keys ' ballads with its `` quiet , unassuming verses leading into big , empathic choruses .

Such events can reduce the variation in the gene pool of a population ; thereafter , a smaller population , with a correspondingly smaller genetic diversity , remains to pass on genes to future generations of offspring through sexual reproduction . Genetic diversity remains lower , increasing only when gene flow with another population occurs or very slowly increasing with time as random mutations occur . As a consequence of such population size reductions and the loss of genetic variation , the robustness of the population is reduced and its ability to adapt to and survive selecting environmental changes , like climate change or a shift in available resources , is reduced . Alternatively , if by chance survivors of the bottleneck are the individuals with the greatest genetic fitness , the frequency of the fitter genes within the gene pool is increased , while the pool itself is reduced . </P>", "<P> The Aswan Dam , or more specifically since the 1960s , the Aswan High Dam , is an embankment dam built across the Nile in Aswan , Egypt , between 1960 and 1970 . Its significance largely eclipsed the previous Aswan Low Dam initially completed in 1902 downstream . Based on the success of the Low Dam , then at its maximum utilization , construction of the High Dam became a key objective of the government following the Egyptian Revolution of 1952 ; with its ability to control flooding better , provide increased water storage for irrigation and generate hydroelectricity the dam was seen as pivotal to Egypt 's planned industrialization .

Future brides and grooms may be called the betrothed , a wife - to - be or husband - to - be , fianc\u00e9e or fianc\u00e9 ( from the French word of the same form ) , respectively . The duration of the courtship varies vastly , and is largely dependent on cultural norms or upon the agreement of the parties involved . </P>", "<P> G phase is a period of rapid cell growth and protein synthesis during which the cell prepares itself for mitosis . Curiously , G phase is not a necessary part of the cell cycle , as some cell types ( particularly young Xenopus embryos and some cancers ) proceed directly from DNA replication to mitosis . Though much is known about the genetic network which regulates G2 phase and subsequent entry into mitosis , there is still much to be discovered concerning its significance and regulation , particularly in regards to cancer . One hypothesis is that the growth in G phase is regulated as a method of cell size control . Fission yeast ( Schizosaccharomyces pombe ) has been previously shown to employ such a mechanism , via Cdr2 - mediated spatial regulation of Wee1 activity . Though Wee1 is a fairly conserved negative regulator of mitotic entry , no general mechanism of cell size control in G2 has yet been elucidated . </P>", "<P> The Wilcoxon signed - rank test is a non-parametric statistical hypothesis test used to compare two related samples , matched samples , or repeated measurements on a single sample to assess whether their population mean ranks differ ( i.e. it is a paired difference test ) . It can be used as an alternative to the paired Student 's t - test , t - test for matched pairs , or the t - test for dependent samples when the population can not be assumed to be normally distributed . A Wilcoxon signed - rank test is a nonparametric test that can be used to determine whether two dependent samples were selected from populations having the same distribution . </P>", "<P> Winds within high - pressure areas flow outward from the higher pressure areas near their centers towards the lower pressure areas further from their centers . Gravity adds to the forces causing this general movement , because the higher pressure compresses the column of air near the center of the area into greater density -- and so greater weight compared to lower pressure , lower density , and lower weight of the air outside the center . </P>", "<P> `` Tears in Heaven '' is a song by Eric Clapton and Will Jennings , from the 1991 Rush film soundtrack .

Most notably , Bt toxins are insecticidal to the larvae of moths and butterflies , beetles , cotton bollworms and ghtu flies but are harmless to other forms of life . The gene coding for Bt toxin has been inserted into cotton as a transgene , causing it to produce this natural insecticide in its tissues . In many regions , the main pests in commercial cotton are lepidopteran larvae , which are killed by the Bt protein in the genetically modified cotton they eat . This eliminates the need to use large amounts of broad - spectrum insecticides to kill lepidopteran pests ( some of which have developed pyrethroid resistance ) . This spares natural insect predators in the farm ecology and further contributes to noninsecticide pest management . </P>", "<P> Richard Webber , M.D. is a fictional character from the ABC medical drama television series Grey 's Anatomy .

Hank is the only character to appear in every single story in the series . Hank claims to be a `` purebred top - of - the - line blue - ribbon cowdog '' but is in fact most likely a mutt . He styles himself as the `` Head of Ranch Security '' and conducts security sweeps and nightly patrols . However his real task is to serve as the assistant to Slim and Loper in herding cattle . Hank has a superiority complex which causes him to have an inflated sense of his own intelligence , strength , courage and attractiveness . As a result of this , Hank frequently finds himself in sticky situations , usually of his own creation . Much of the humor of the series comes from Hank as narrator shamelessly attempting to make himself seem more competent with hindsight than he really was , but the reader is rarely fooled . Despite his flaws Hank is deeply loyal to his family and the ranch community and usually rises to the occasion at the moment of true crisis . The dog is based on an Australian Shepherd named Hank that was owned by a neighbor of Erickson 's when he was managing a ranch in Oklahoma . The neighbor wanted to use the dog to help with the cattle but the dog was not trained and proved a hassle . </P>", "<P> Dart frogs are the focus of major phylogenetic studies , and undergo taxonomic changes frequently .

In the recent 2003 book SYNC -- the Emerging Science of Spontaneous Order by Steven Strogatz , for example , we find `` Scientists have often been baffled by the existence of spontaneous order in the universe . The laws of thermodynamics seem to dictate the opposite , that nature should inexorably degenerate toward a state of greater disorder , greater entropy . Yet all around us we see magnificent structures -- galaxies , cells , ecosystems , human beings -- that have all somehow managed to assemble themselves .

Because Ralph appears responsible for bringing all the survivors together , he immediately commands some authority over the other boys and is quickly elected their `` chief '' . He does not receive the votes of the members of a boys ' choir , led by the red - headed Jack Merridew , although he allows the choir boys to form a separate clique of hunters . Ralph establishes three primary policies : to have fun , to survive , and to constantly maintain a smoke signal that could alert passing ships to their presence on the island and thus rescue them . The boys establish a form of democracy by declaring that whoever holds the conch shall also be able to speak at their formal gatherings and receive the attentive silence of the larger group . </P>", "<P> `` Castle on the Hill '' is a song by English singer - songwriter Ed Sheeran .

In Locke 's philosophy , tabula rasa was the theory that at birth the ( human ) mind is a `` blank slate '' without rules for processing data , and that data is added and rules for processing are formed solely by one 's sensory experiences . The notion is central to Lockean empiricism . As understood by Locke , tabula rasa meant that the mind of the individual was born blank , and it also emphasized the freedom of individuals to author their own soul . Individuals are free to define the content of their character -- but basic identity as a member of the human species can not be altered .

More generally , escape velocity is the speed at which the sum of an object 's kinetic energy and its gravitational potential energy is equal to zero ; an object which has achieved escape velocity is neither on the surface , nor in a closed orbit ( of any radius ) . With escape velocity in a direction pointing away from the ground of a massive body , the object will move away from the body , slowing forever and approaching , but never reaching , zero speed . Once escape velocity is achieved , no further impulse need be applied for it to continue in its escape . In other words , if given escape velocity , the object will move away from the other body , continually slowing , and will asymptotically approach zero speed as the object 's distance approaches infinity , never to come back . Speeds higher than escape velocity have a positive speed at infinity . Note that the minimum escape velocity assumes that there is no friction ( e.g. , atmospheric drag ) , which would increase the required instantaneous velocity to escape the gravitational influence , and that there will be no future sources of additional velocity ( e.g. , thrust ) , which would reduce the required instantaneous velocity . </P>", "<P> The Picture of Dorian Gray is a philosophical novel by Oscar Wilde , first published complete in the July 1890 issue of Lippincott 's Monthly Magazine .

With no immediate response , a small number of Fascists began a long trek across Italy to Rome which was known as the `` March on Rome '' , claiming to Italians that Fascists were intending to restore law and order . Mussolini himself did not participate until the very end of the march , with D'Annunzio being hailed as leader of the march until it was learned that he had been pushed out of a window and severely wounded in a failed assassination attempt , depriving him of the possibility of leading an actual coup d'\u00e9tat orchestrated by an organization founded by himself . Under the leadership of Mussolini , the Fascists demanded Prime Minister Luigi Facta 's resignation and that Mussolini be named Prime Minister . Although the Italian Army was far better armed than the Fascist paramilitaries , the Italian government under King Vittorio Emmanuele III faced a political crisis .

In the 1860s , the boulevards and streets of Paris were illuminated by 56,000 gas lamps . Since the late 19th century , Paris has also been known as Panam ( e ) ( pronounced ( panam ) ) in French slang . </P>", "<P> Alice ( n\u00e9e Alice Gibson ) , played in the first nine skits , starting in 1951 , and ending in January 1952 by Pert Kelton , and by Audrey Meadows for all remaining episodes , is Ralph 's patient but sharp - tongued wife of roughly 12 years . She often finds herself bearing the brunt of Ralph 's insults , which she returns with biting sarcasm . She is levelheaded , in contrast to Ralph 's pattern of inventing various schemes to enhance his wealth or his pride . In each case , she sees the current one 's un-workability , but he becomes angry and ignores her advice ( and by the end of the episode , her misgivings almost always are proven to have been well - founded ) . She has grown accustomed to his empty threats -- such as `` One of these days , POW ! ! ! Right in the kisser ! '' , `` BANG , ZOOM ! '' or `` You 're going to the moon ! '' -- to which she usually replies , `` Ahhh , shaddap ! '' Alice studied to be a secretary before her marriage and works briefly in that capacity when Ralph is laid off . Wilma Flintstone is based on Alice Kramden . </P>", "<P> The Congress regularly observed 26 January as the Independence Day of India -- commemorating those who campaigned for Indian independence . In 1947 , the British agreed to transfer power and political finesse to India , and 15 August became the official Independence Day . However , the new Constitution of India , as drafted and approved by the Constituent Assembly , was mandated to take effect on 26 January 1950 , to commemorate the 1930 declaration . On that day in 1950 , India became a republic . 26 January is now celebrated as Republic Day of India every year . </P>", "<P> Mighty Max was a series of toys that were manufactured by Bluebird Toys PLC in the UK in 1992 , and designed by Big Monster Toys . The toys were similar to the earlier Polly Pocket toyline ; however , these toys were marketed primarily towards young boys . In Canada and the USA , they were distributed by Irwin Toy Limited and Mattel Inc. respectively . The original toyline consisted mainly of `` Doom Zones '' and `` Horror Heads . '' `` Doom Zones '' were small playsets with a horror theme and featured miniature figurines of menacing creatures and the hero Max , a young boy with blond hair , jeans , a white t - shirt with a red `` M '' on it , and a baseball cap ( the color varied based on the playset purchased ) which also always had an `` M '' on it . The `` Horror Heads '' were smaller - sized playsets , also shaped like the heads of creatures and contained miniature figures . It was later adapted into a TV series , as well as a tie - in video game produced by Ocean Software for the Super NES and Mega Drive / Genesis . </P>", "<P> The Pittsburgh Steelers ( 6 -- 2 ) have won the most Super Bowls with six championships , while the New England Patriots ( 5 - 4 ) , the Dallas Cowboys ( 5 -- 3 ) , and the San Francisco 49ers ( 5 -- 1 ) have five wins . New England has the most Super Bowl appearances with nine , while the Buffalo Bills ( 0 -- 4 ) have the most consecutive appearances with four losses in a row from 1990 to 1993 . The Miami Dolphins are the only other team to have at least three consecutive appearances : 1972 -- 74 . The Denver Broncos ( 3 -- 5 ) have lost a record five Super Bowls . The New England Patriots ( 5 -- 4 ) , the Minnesota Vikings ( 0 -- 4 ) , and the Bills have lost four . The record for consecutive wins is two and is shared by seven franchises : the 1966 -- 67 Green Bay Packers , the 1972 -- 73 Miami Dolphins , the 1974 -- 75 and 1978 -- 79 Pittsburgh Steelers ( the only team to accomplish this feat twice ) , the 1988 -- 89 San Francisco 49ers , the 1992 -- 93 Dallas Cowboys , the 1997 -- 98 Denver Broncos , and the 2003 -- 04 New England Patriots . Among those , Dallas ( 1992 -- 93 ; 1995 ) and New England ( 2001 ; 2003 -- 04 ) are the only teams to win three out of four consecutive Super Bowls . The 1972 Dolphins capped off the only perfect season in NFL history with their victory in Super Bowl VII . The only team with multiple Super Bowl appearances and no losses is the Baltimore Ravens , who in winning Super Bowl XLVII defeated and replaced the 49ers in that position . Four current NFL teams have never appeared in a Super Bowl , including franchise relocations and renaming : the Cleveland Browns , Detroit Lions , Jacksonville Jaguars , and Houston Texans , though both the Browns ( 1964 ) and Lions ( 1957 ) had won NFL championship games prior to the creation of the Super Bowl . </P>", "<Ol> <Li> Vascular spasm ( Vasoconstriction ) - Vasoconstriction is produced by vascular smooth muscle cells , and is the blood vessel 's first response to injury . The smooth muscle cells are controlled by vascular endothelium , which releases intravascular signals to control the contracting properties . When a blood vessel is damaged , there is an immediate reflex , initiated by local sympathetic pain receptors , which helps promote vasoconstriction . The damaged vessels will constrict ( vasoconstrict ) which reduces the amount of blood flow through the area and limits the amount of blood loss . Collagen is exposed at the site of injury , the collagen promotes platelets to adhere to the injury site . Platelets release cytoplasmic granules which contain serotonin , ADP and thromboxane A2 , all of which increase the effect of vasoconstriction . The spasm response becomes more effective as the amount of damage is increased . Vascular spasm is much more effective in smaller blood vessels . </Li> <Li> Platelet plug formation - Platelets adhere to damaged endothelium to form a platelet plug ( primary hemostasis ) and then degranulate . This process is regulated through thromboregulation . Plug formation is activated by a glycoprotein called Von Willebrand factor ( vWF ) , which is found in plasma . Platelets play one of major roles in the hemostatic process . When platelets come across the injured endothelium cells , they change shape , release granules and ultimately become ' sticky ' . Platelets express certain receptors , some of which are used for the adhesion of platelets to collagen . When platelets are activated , they express glycoprotein receptors that interact with other platelets , producing aggregation and adhesion . Platelets release cytoplasmic granules such as adenosine diphosphate ( ADP ) , serotonin and thromboxane A2 . Adenosine diphosphate ( ADP ) attracts more platelets to the affected area , serotonin is a vasoconstrictor and thromboxane A2 assists in platelet aggregation , vasoconstriction and degranulation . As more chemicals are released more platelets stick and release their chemicals ; creating a platelet plug and continuing the process in a positive feedback loop . Platelets alone are responsible for stopping the bleeding of unnoticed wear and tear of our skin on a daily basis . This is referred to as primary hemostasis . </Li> <Li> Clot formation - Once the platelet plug has been formed by the platelets , the clotting factors ( a dozen proteins that travel along the blood plasma in an inactive state ) are activated in a sequence of events known as ' coagulation cascade ' which leads to the formation of Fibrin from inactive fibrinogen plasma protein . Thus , a Fibrin mesh is produced all around the platelet plug to hold it in place ; this step is called `` Secondary Hemostasis '' . During this process some red and white blood cells are trapped in the mesh which causes the primary hemostasis plug to become harder : the resultant plug is called as ' thrombus ' or ' Clot ' . Therefore ' blood clot ' contains secondary hemostasis plug with blood cells trapped in it . Though this is often a good step for wound healing , it has the ability to cause severe health problems if the thrombus becomes detached from the vessel wall and travels through the circulatory system ; If it reaches the brain , heart or lungs it could lead to stroke , heart attack , or pulmonary embolism respectively . However , without this process the healing of a wound would not be possible . </Li> </Ol>", "<P> At least 25 laureates have received the Nobel Prize for contributions in the field of organic chemistry , more than any other field of chemistry . Two Nobel Prize laureates in Chemistry , Germans Richard Kuhn ( 1938 ) and Adolf Butenandt ( 1939 ) , were not allowed by their government to accept the prize . They would later receive a medal and diploma , but not the money . Frederick Sanger is one out of two laureates to be awarded the Nobel prize twice in the same subject , in 1958 and 1980 . John Bardeen is the other and was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics in 1956 and 1972 . Two others have won Nobel Prizes twice , one in chemistry and one in another subject : Maria Sk\u0142odowska - Curie ( physics in 1903 , chemistry in 1911 ) and Linus Pauling ( chemistry in 1954 , peace in 1962 ) . As of 2017 , the prize has been awarded to 177 individuals , including four women : Maria Sk\u0142odowska - Curie , Ir\u00e8ne Joliot - Curie ( 1935 ) , Dorothy Hodgkin ( 1964 ) , and Ada Yonath ( 2009 ) . There have been eight years in which the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was not awarded . </P>", "<P> Juxtaglomerular cells secrete renin in response to a drop in pressure detected by stretch receptors in the vascular walls , or when stimulated by macula densa cells . Macula densa cells are located in the distal convoluted tubule , and stimulate juxtaglomerular cells to release renin when they detect a drop in sodium concentration in tubular fluid . Together , juxtaglomerular cells , extraglomerular mesangial cells and macula densa cells comprise the juxtaglomerular complex . </P>", "<P> An oxbow lake is a U-shaped lake that forms when a wide meander from the main stem of a river is cut off , creating a free - standing body of water .

Provincially , each region had their specific adoption or fostering program and policy . For example , Saskatchewan had the Adopt Indian Metis ( AIM ) Program . The children were typically placed for adoption or fostering in Canada though a few were placed in the United States or western Europe . The term `` Sixties scoop '' was coined by Patrick Johnston in his 1983 report Native Children and the Child Welfare System . It is a variation of the broader term Baby Scoop Era to refer to the period from the late 1950s to 1980s when large numbers of children were taken from their parents for adoption .

The limbic system is where the subcortical structures meet the cerebral cortex . The limbic system operates by influencing the endocrine system and the autonomic nervous system . It is highly interconnected with the nucleus accumbens , which plays a role in sexual arousal and the `` high '' derived from certain recreational drugs . These responses are heavily modulated by dopaminergic projections from the limbic system . In 1954 , Olds and Milner found that rats with metal electrodes implanted into their nucleus accumbens , as well as their septal nuclei , repeatedly pressed a lever activating this region , and did so in preference to eating and drinking , eventually dying of exhaustion . The limbic system also includes the basal ganglia . The basal ganglia are a set of subcortical structures that direct intentional movements . The basal ganglia are located near the thalamus and hypothalamus . They receive input from the cerebral cortex , which sends outputs to the motor centers in the brain stem . A part of the basal ganglia called the striatum controls posture and movement . Recent studies indicate that , if there is an inadequate supply of dopamine , the striatum is affected , which can lead to visible behavioral symptoms of Parkinson 's disease . </P>", "<P> The Commission established a special Universal Declaration of Human Rights Drafting Committee , chaired by Eleanor Roosevelt , to write the articles of the Declaration .

In the twentieth century , focus gradually shifted to include right hemisphere damage ( Brookshire , 2007 ) . It is now well established that language and cognition can be seriously impaired by unilateral right hemisphere brain damage . Specific cognitive tests can help diagnose the existence of right hemisphere brain damage and differentiate symptoms from those of left hemisphere damage . Unlike the aphasias , caused by left hemisphere damage and generally resulting in focused language deficits , right hemisphere brain damage can result in a variety of diffuse deficits which complicate formal testing of this disorder ( Brookshire , 2007 ) . These formal tests assess areas such as understanding humor , metaphors , sarcasm , facial expression , and prosody . However , not all individuals with right hemisphere brain damage have problems in language or communication and some may have no discernible symptoms . Indeed , about half of patients with right hemisphere damage have intact communication abilities ( Brookshire , 2007 ) . </P>", "<P> The Eisenhower Tunnel , officially the Eisenhower -- Edwin C.

Powering up also causes the poison to spread rapidly through Gohan 's body . Lavender mounts a comeback . In desperation , Gohan grabs hold of Lavender and launches a kamikaze attack . He drives both of their bodies into the ring at high speed . Lavender is knocked out , but Gohan is so weakened by the poison that he can not continue .

Some authors use the term enormity . While every sin is seen as an offense to Allah , the al - Kaba'ir are the gravest of the offenses . Allah 's power is thought to be only eclipsed by his mercy and thus small sins are tacitly understood to be forgiven after repentance . Not every sin is equal however and some are thought to be more spiritually damning than others . The greatest of the sins described as al - Kaba'ir is the association of others with Allah or Shirk . Scholar differ as to how many major sins there are . In contrasting major sins with minor sins ( al - sagha'ir ) , the eighth - century Shafi'i scholar Al - Dhahabi found the hadith collections of Sahih al - Bukhari and Muslim ibn al - Hajjaj listed seven major sins , while the tradition from Abd Allah ibn Abbas stated that there were closer to seventy major sins . </P>", "<P> These intestinal lining cells can then either store the iron as ferritin , which is accomplished by Fe binding to apoferritin ( in which case the iron will leave the body when the cell dies and is sloughed off into feces ) , or the cell can release it into the body via the only known iron exporter in mammals , ferroportin . Hephaestin , a ferroxidase that can oxidize Fe to Fe and is found mainly in the small intestine , helps ferroportin transfer iron across the basolateral end of the intestine cells . In contrast , ferroportin is post-translationally repressed by hepcidin , a 25 - amino acid peptide hormone . The body regulates iron levels by regulating each of these steps .

The first cartographic appearance of Apalchen is on Diego Guti\u00e9rrez ' map of 1562 ; the first use for the mountain range is the map of Jacques le Moyne de Morgues in 1565 .

Pharyngeal slits are repeated openings that appear along the pharynx caudal to the mouth . With this position , they allow for the movement of water in the mouth and out the pharyngeal slits . It 's postulated that this is how pharyngeal slits first assisted in filter - feeding , and later with the addition of gills along their walls , aided in respiration of aquatic chordates . These repeated segments are controlled by similar developmental mechanisms . Some hemichordate species can have as many as 200 gill slits . Pharyngeal slits resembling gill slits are transiently present during the embryonic stages of tetrapod development . The presence of gill - like slits in the neck of the developing human embryo famously led Ernst Haeckel to postulate that `` ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny '' ; this hypothesis , while false , contains elements of truth , as explored by Stephen Jay Gould in Ontogeny and Phylogeny . However , it is now accepted that it is the vertebrate pharyngeal pouches and not the neck slits that are homologous to the pharyngeal slits of invertebrate chordates . Gill slits are , at some stage of life , found in all chordates . One theory of their origin is the fusion of nephridia which opened both on the outside and the gut , creating openings between the gut and the environment . </P>", "<P> On January 1 , 1973 , the Central Bank of Nigeria introduced notes for 50 kobo , 1 , 5 , 10 and 20 naira .

'' Conversely to Mendelson , Alexander commented on the different marketing strategy for the film between the convention footage scenes and the trailer scenes , feeling the `` two could n't be more different '' . She noted how the convention footage ( `` meant to please a crowd running on little sleep and jittery with anticipation '' ) was released between Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 and Thor : Ragnarok , and `` ( i ) t made sense to use Thor and the Guardians to hype up ( Infinity War ) '' because `` Marvel relied on the anticipation of Thor : Ragnarok and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 's success to excite fans , and footage of older movies set to classic Marvel scores as a way to drive home how this movie is an event in itself . '' Conversely , the trailer ( `` designed to explain what 's about to happen , teasing it out with additional background '' ) heavily featured Black Panther and Wakanda , which Alexander said could not have been done earlier , without the additional marketing for Black Panther that happened after the conventions to provide additional context . Gael Cooper of CNET observed that the trailer was viewed nearly 500,000 times in its first 15 minutes after it was posted on YouTube , but questioned if the trailer broke the site after the view counter appeared to be stuck at 467,331 . The trailer was viewed 230 million times in its first 24 hours , becoming the most viewed trailer in that time period , surpassing the record of It . </P>", "<P> The phrase `` under God '' was incorporated into the Pledge of Allegiance on June 14 , 1954 , by a Joint Resolution of Congress amending \u00a7 4 of the Flag Code enacted in 1942 . </P>", "<P> Orange Is the New Black is an American comedy - drama series created by Jenji Kohan that airs on Netflix .

The gravitational attraction of Earth 's mass prevents other non-thermal loss processes from appreciably depleting the atmosphere . Yet Earth 's atmosphere is two orders of magnitude less dense than that of Venus at the surface . Because of the temperature regime of Earth , CO and H O are sequestered in the hydrosphere and lithosphere . H O vapor is sequestered as liquid H O in oceans , greatly decreasing the atmospheric density . With liquid water running over the surface of Earth , CO can be drawn down from the atmosphere and sequestered in sedimentary rocks . Some estimates indicate that nearly all carbon on Earth is contained in sedimentary rocks , with the atmospheric portion being approximately 1 / 250,000 of Earth 's CO reservoir . If both of the reservoirs were released to the atmosphere , Earth 's atmosphere would be even denser than Venus 's atmosphere . Therefore , the dominant `` loss '' mechanism of Earth 's atmosphere is not escape to space , but sequestration . However , in 1 billion years ' time , the Sun will be 10 % brighter than it is now , making it hot enough for Earth to lose enough hydrogen to space to cause it to lose all of its water ( See Future of Earth # Loss of oceans ) . </P>", "<Table> <Tr> <Th> No . </Th> <Th> Title </Th> <Th> Original air date </Th> <Th> English air date </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 276 </Th> <Td> `` Attack of the Gedo Statue '' `` Ged\u014d Maz\u014d no Sh\u016brai '' ( \u5916\u9053 \u9b54 \u50cf \u306e \u8972\u6765 ) </Td> <Td> August 23 , 2012 </Td> <Td> January 10 , 2015 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"4\"> Black Zetsu finally locates the Feudal Lords ' mansion and commences his attack .

Enzymes interact with a substrate by means of strain or distortions , moving the substrate towards the transition state . Transition state analogs can be used as inhibitors in enzyme - catalyzed reactions by blocking the active site of the enzyme . Theory suggests that enzyme inhibitors which resembled the transition state structure would bind more tightly to the enzyme than the actual substrate . Examples of drugs that are transition state analog inhibitors include flu medications such as the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir and the HIV protease inhibitors saquinavir in the treatment of AIDS . </P>", "<P> The song first appeared in the soundtrack of the Martin and Lewis comedy film The Caddy , released by Paramount Pictures on August 10 , 1953 .

Each side holds its own . Vegeta tells Goku that he can not beat him with attacks like that . The cloned Vegeta backs Goku into a corner . Goku teleports behind his opponent and lands a blow on him , which briefly turns the battle in his favor . Vegeta starts getting frustrated that his clone is failing to dodge certain attacks and begins cheering for the clone when it knocks Goku away . Trunks reminds Vegeta that if they do not defeat the clone , Vegeta would die . Vegeta attempts to attack the clone himself , but he fails to do any damage . Frustrated , Vegeta criticizes both his clone and Goku . Goku begins wondering whose side Vegeta is on . He and the cloned Vegeta quickly power up , and the two continue their fight . Jaco points out that Vegeta is even more transparent than before . Potaji tells Vegeta to use Komeson to gain time . Trunks wonders if there might be another way to save Vegeta in case their plan fails . Potaji suggests that the Komeson should be destroyed to weaken the clones it had created . Trunks , Goten , Potaji , and Jaco fly away to retrieve the weapon . Meanwhile , Goku manages to fight off cloned Vegeta . Vegeta is frustrated that it is Goku who is fighting the clone and not him . The fight causes a destructive shock wave . Komeson takes advantage of this and quickly attacks Trunks . Vegeta feels that Trunks is in trouble and tries to reach him . Monaka accidentally steps on Komeson 's core behind him , which damages it along with its clones . Potaji notes that even though the core was destroyed , time has run out and Vegeta is disappearing . Realizing this is his last chance , Goku destroys the cloned Vegeta . As a result , Vegeta 's body regenerates and Potaji reseals Komeson . Goku thanks Monaka for his help and says that he would have been beaten by the cloned Vegeta if it were not for him . With the Planet Potofu saved and the threat destroyed , Goku and the others return to Earth . Meanwhile , in an annihilated alternate timeline , Future Trunks looks to destroy a new threat that has been terrorizing his world . </Td> </Tr> </Table>", "<P> Traditionally associated with the progressive movement , the club was one of the first large - scale environmental preservation organizations in the world , and currently engages in lobbying politicians to promote environmentalist policies .

Stayton was a prominent figure in the anti-prohibition fight , founding the Association Against the Prohibition Amendment in 1918 . The AAPA was the largest of the nearly forty organizations that fought to end Prohibition . Economic urgency played a large part in accelerating the advocacy for repeal . The number of conservatives who pushed for prohibition in the beginning decreased . Many farmers who fought for prohibition now fought for repeal because of the negative effects it had on the agriculture business . Prior to the 1920 implementation of the Volstead Act , approximately 14 % of federal , state , and local tax revenues were derived from alcohol commerce . When the Great Depression hit and tax revenues plunged , the governments needed this revenue stream . Millions could be made by taxing beer . There was controversy on whether the repeal should be a state or nationwide decision . On March 22 , 1933 , President Franklin Roosevelt signed an amendment to the Volstead Act , known as the Cullen -- Harrison Act , allowing the manufacture and sale of 3.2 % beer ( 3.2 % alcohol by weight , approximately 4 % alcohol by volume ) and light wines .

As an example , one of Hayley 's temporary breakups with Jeff expanded across a string of episodes , in which she instead temporarily dated a black man in a koala body , Reginald Koala -- known for his very urban mannerisms and behaviors . As another example , since the 9th season episode `` Naked to the Limit , One More Time '' , Jeff Fischer has been absent from the Smith house and planet Earth altogether . In that episode , Jeff is blindsided when Roger hurls him into a spaceship . This spacecraft belongs to Roger 's race of aliens and was intended to return him back to his birth planet ; however , Roger remains behind after casting Jeff into the spaceship . The spaceship immediately takes off and Jeff is not seen until several episodes later , the episode `` Lost in Space '' . During episodes that aired between the two aforementioned episodes , allusions to the ongoing plot line are made . For example , in the episode `` Spelling Bee My Baby '' , Hayley is shown holding out hope for Jeff 's return . In the episode , Roger and Stan attempt to rush Hayley through her grieving process so she will be willing to be their tennis official . In the episode `` The Longest Distance Relationship '' Jeff gets in touch with Hayley via a radio and ultimately tells her not to wait for him and to move on with her life . This story arc is finally resolved in the episode `` Holy Shit , Jeff 's Back ! '' , Jeff supposedly returns to Earth but it turns out to be an alien called Zebleer masquerading as Jeff and the real Jeff has been dissected , however Jeff 's brain is transplanted into Zebleer 's body allowing the real Jeff to live , after which Stan and Hayley 's memories are wiped , leaving them unaware that Jeff is no longer entirely human . This plot point is continued at the end of `` Bahama Mama '' , where Roger mentions Jeff can not get Hayley pregnant because he has an alien body , so he agrees to rebirth Jeff in `` Roger 's Baby '' . By the end of the episode , Jeff is human again and with Hayley on Earth . </P>", "<P> Being 1,000 miles ( 1,609 km ) from any large body of water ( with the exception of Lake Superior ) , temperatures and precipitation in North Dakota can vary widely .

Historians have traditionally divided the war into three phases . In the first phase , the Archidamian War , Sparta launched repeated invasions of Attica , while Athens took advantage of its naval supremacy to raid the coast of the Peloponnese and attempt to suppress signs of unrest in its empire . This period of the war was concluded in 421 BC , with the signing of the Peace of Nicias . That treaty , however , was soon undermined by renewed fighting in the Peloponnese . In 415 BC , Athens dispatched a massive expeditionary force to attack Syracuse in Sicily ; the attack failed disastrously , with the destruction of the entire force , in 413 BC . This ushered in the final phase of the war , generally referred to either as the Decelean War , or the Ionian War . In this phase , Sparta , now receiving support from Persia , supported rebellions in Athens ' subject states in the Aegean Sea and Ionia , undermining Athens ' empire , and , eventually , depriving the city of naval supremacy . The destruction of Athens ' fleet at Aegospotami effectively ended the war , and Athens surrendered in the following year . Corinth and Thebes demanded that Athens should be destroyed and all its citizens should be enslaved , but Sparta refused . </P>", "<P> The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet was an American sitcom , which aired on ABC from October 3 , 1952 through April 23 , 1966 , and starred the real - life Nelson family .

Teams can be penalised for intentionally causing the scrum to collapse , and for not putting the ball into the scrum correctly .

Chiang received the help of the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communist Party ; however , he soon dismissed his Soviet advisors .

Chiang decided to strike first and purged the Communists , killing thousands of them . At the same time , other violent conflicts took place in the south of China where the Communist Party fielded superior numbers and were massacring Nationalist supporters . These events eventually led to the Chinese Civil War between the Nationalist Party and the Communist Party . Chiang Kai - shek pushed the Communist Party into the interior as he sought to destroy them , and moved the Nationalist Government to Nanjing in 1927 . Leftists within the KMT still allied to the communists , lead by Wang Jingwei , had established a rival Nationalist Government in Wuhan two months earlier , but soon joined Chiang in Nanjing in August 1927 . By the following year , Chiang 's army had captured Beijing after overthrowing the Beiyang government and unified the entire nation , at least nominally , marking the beginning the Nanjing Decade . </P>", "<P> The level of immigration peaked in 1993 in the last year of the Progressive Conservative government and was maintained by Liberal Party of Canada . Ambitious targets of an annual 1 % per capita immigration rate were hampered by financial constraints . The Liberals committed to raising actual immigration levels further in 2005 . All political parties are now cautious about criticizing the high level of immigration . Consequently , immigration levels to Canada ( roughly 0.7 % per year ) are considerably higher per capita than to the United States ( about a million , or 0.3 % , per year ) . Further , much of the immigration to the United States is from Latin America , with relatively less from Asia ; the United States only admits about twice as many immigrants from Asian countries like China , India , the Philippines , and Pakistan as Canada , despite having nine times the population . Due to this , the largest minority in the United States is the Latin American population , while Canada 's largest minority is its Asian population . </P>", "<P> Starting on a small scale , training just a few boys on a dust pitch in Accra , the Academy has evolved over the last 16 years to become a fully residential , centre of excellence , with over 90 students on scholarship from 7 African countries , at a purpose - built campus on the banks of the River Volta . </P>", "<P> In May 2017 , ABC renewed AFV for a 28th season which premiered at 8 / 7 central ( still an hour - long on Sunday nights ) for the first time since 2003 on October 8 , 2017 due to ABC airing ( and premiering on Sunday , October 1 , 2017 ) the 2nd season of The Toy Box at 7 / 6 central on Sunday nights . Whether or not AFV returns to 7 / 6 central once The Toy Box ends it 's 2nd season in November 2017 is yet to be determined . </P>", "<P> The Vietnam War ( Vietnamese : Chi\u1ebfn tranh Vi\u1ec7t Nam ) , also known as the Second Indochina War , and also known in Vietnam as the Resistance War Against America ( Vietnamese : Kh\u00e1ng chi\u1ebfn ch\u1ed1ng M\u1ef9 ) or simply the American War , was a conflict that occurred in Vietnam , Laos , and Cambodia from 1 November 1955 to the fall of Saigon on 30 April 1975 . It was the second of the Indochina Wars and was officially fought between North Vietnam and the government of South Vietnam . The North Vietnamese army was supported by the Soviet Union , China and other communist allies and the South Vietnamese army was supported by the United States , South Korea , Australia , Thailand and other anti-communist allies . The war is therefore considered a Cold War - era proxy war . </P>", "<P> The first season of the American animated television sitcom SpongeBob SquarePants , created by former marine biologist and animator Stephen Hillenburg , aired from May 1 , 1999 to April 8 , 2000 , and consists of 20 episodes .

During this stage of the star 's lifetime , it is located along the main sequence at a position determined primarily by its mass , but also based upon its chemical composition and other factors . All main - sequence stars are in hydrostatic equilibrium , where outward thermal pressure from the hot core is balanced by the inward pressure of gravitational collapse from the overlying layers . The strong dependence of the rate of energy generation in the core on the temperature and pressure helps to sustain this balance . Energy generated at the core makes its way to the surface and is radiated away at the photosphere . The energy is carried by either radiation or convection , with the latter occurring in regions with steeper temperature gradients , higher opacity or both . </P>", "<P> In the United States , an executive order is a directive issued by the President of the United States that manages operations of the federal government , and have the force of law .

It was like having our own film school . '' Miller stated that del Toro was particularly involved in Humpty 's character design . `` Guillermo loved the dreamy quality of Humpty Dumpty . He suggested we push that further , make him more like da Vinci . '' It was del Toro 's idea to make Humpty `` an ingenious freak of nature '' who builds contraptions such as a flying machine . Del Toro rewrote the ending to redeem the character and deepen his relationship with Puss -- an unconventional conclusion for a children 's film .

Because of the Temple Mount entry restrictions , the Wall is the holiest place where Jews are permitted to pray , though the holiest site in the Jewish faith lies behind it . The original , natural , and irregular - shaped Temple Mount was gradually extended to allow for an ever - larger Temple compound to be built at its top . This process was finalised by Herod , who enclosed the Mount with an almost rectangular set of retaining walls , built to support extensive substructures and earth fills needed to give the natural hill a geometrically regular shape . On top of this box - like structure Herod built a vast paved esplanade which surrounded the Temple . Of the four retaining walls , the western one is considered to be closest to the former Temple , which makes it the most sacred site recognised by Judaism outside the former Temple Mount esplanade .

Luckdragons possess neither an immense physical strength , nor great magical talents , though they can exhale fire , which is blue , as when Falkor fights Ygramul . Their only distinctive ability that sets them apart is incredible luck in everything they do , as shown when Falkor locates and rescues his companion after being lost in a violent , blinding storm . When in flight , a luckdragon is in constant motion . Luckdragons never stop drawing air and heat through their scales , which makes eating unnecessary and makes submersion in water deadly to them . Luckdragons are capable of sleeping while flying , and prefer to occupy as much open space as possible . </P>", "<Dl> <Dd> The family patriarch , Jack is Amy and Lou 's grandfather and was Marion 's father .

The validity of this argument depends on whether intrinsic rewards qualify as `` benefits '' .

He encouraged military support for the Byzantine Empire and its Emperor , Alexios I , who needed reinforcements for his conflict with westward migrating Turks colonizing Anatolia . One of Urban 's aims was to guarantee pilgrims access to the Eastern Mediterranean holy sites that were under Muslim control but scholars disagree as to whether this was the primary motive for Urban or those who heeded his call . Urban 's strategy may have been to unite the Eastern and Western branches of Christendom , which had been divided since the East -- West Schism of 1054 and to establish himself as head of the unified Church . The initial success of the Crusade established the first four Crusader states in the Eastern Mediterranean : the County of Edessa , the Principality of Antioch , the Kingdom of Jerusalem and the County of Tripoli . The enthusiastic response to Urban 's preaching from all classes in Western Europe established a precedent for other Crusades . Volunteers became Crusaders by taking a public vow and receiving plenary indulgences from the Church . Some were hoping for a mass ascension into heaven at Jerusalem or God 's forgiveness for all their sins . Others participated to satisfy feudal obligations , to obtain glory and honour or to seek economic and political gain . </P>", "<P> William James Remar ( born December 31 , 1953 ) , is an American actor and voice actor .

In 1987 , Joey Meyer of the Denver Zephyrs hit the longest verifiable home run in professional baseball history . The home run was measured at a distance of 582 feet ( 177 m ) and was hit inside Denver 's Mile High Stadium . Major League Baseball 's longest verifiable home run distance is about 575 feet ( 175 m ) , by Babe Ruth , to straightaway center field at Tiger Stadium ( then called Navin Field and before the double - deck ) , which landed nearly across the intersection of Trumbull and Cherry . </P>", "<P> Snowboards are generally constructed of a hardwood core which is sandwiched between multiple layers of fibreglass . Some snowboards incorporate the use of more exotic materials such as carbon fiber , Kevlar , aluminium ( as a honeycomb core structure ) , and have incorporated piezo dampers . The front ( or `` nose '' ) of the board is upturned to help the board glide over uneven snow . The back ( or `` tail '' ) of the board is also upturned to enable backwards ( or `` switch '' ) riding . The base ( the side of the board which contacts the ground ) is made of Polyethylene plastic . The two major types of base construction are extruded and sintered . An extruded base is a basic , low - maintenance design which basically consists of the plastic base material melted into its form . A sintered base uses the same material as an extruded base , but first grinds the material into a powder , then , using heat and pressure , molds the material into its desired form . A sintered base is generally softer than its extruded counterpart , but has a porous structure which enables it to absorb wax . This wax absorption ( along with a properly done ' hot wax ' ) , greatly reduces surface friction between the base and the snow , allowing the snowboard to travel on a thin layer of water . Snowboards with sintered bases are much faster , but require semi-regular maintenance and are easier to damage . The bottom edges of the snowboard are fitted with a thin strip of steel , just a couple of millimeters wide . This steel edge allows the board to grab or ' dig into ' hard snow and ice ( like the blade of an ice skate ) , and also protects the boards internal structure . The top of the board is typically a layer of acrylic with some form of graphic designed to attract attention , showcase artwork , or serve the purpose similar to that of any other form of printed media . Flite Snowboards , an early designer , pressed the first closed - molded boards from a garage in Newport , Rhode Island , in the mid-1980s . Snowboard topsheet graphics can be a highly personal statement and many riders spend many hours customizing the look of their boards . The top of some boards may even include thin inlays with other materials , and some are made entirely of epoxy - impregnated wood . The base of the board may also feature graphics , often designed in a manner to make the board 's manufacturer recognizable in photos . </P>", "<P> Bentley was born on November 20 , 1975 in Phoenix , Arizona as the son of Leon Fife Bentley ( August 16 , 1923 -- June 1 , 2012 ) , a bank vice-president , and Catherine Childs .

Lobbying is done by many types of people , associations and organized groups , including individuals in the private sector , corporations , fellow legislators or government officials , or advocacy groups ( interest groups ) . Lobbyists may be among a legislator 's constituencies , meaning a voter or bloc of voters within their electoral district , or not ; they may engage in lobbying as a business , or not . Professional lobbyists are people whose business is trying to influence legislation , regulation , or other government decisions , actions , or policies on behalf of a group or individual who hires them . Individuals and nonprofit organizations can also lobby as an act of volunteering or as a small part of their normal job ( for instance , a CEO meeting with a representative about a project important to their company , or an activist meeting with their legislator in an unpaid capacity ) .

Hence , a pH indicator is a chemical detector for hydronium ions ( H O ) or hydrogen ions ( H ) in the Arrhenius model . Normally , the indicator causes the color of the solution to change depending on the pH . Indicators can also show change in other physical properties ; for example , olfactory indicators show change in their odor . The pH value of a neutral solution is 7.0 . Solutions with a pH value below 7.0 are considered acidic and solutions with pH value above 7.0 are basic ( alkaline ) . As most naturally occurring organic compounds are weak protolytes , carboxylic acids and amines , pH indicators find many applications in biology and analytical chemistry . Moreover , pH indicators form one of the three main types of indicator compounds used in chemical analysis . For the quantitative analysis of metal cations , the use of complexometric indicators is preferred , whereas the third compound class , the redox indicators , are used in titrations involving a redox reaction as the basis of the analysis . </P>", "<P> The Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Democratic Party ( JKPDP ) is a state political party in Jammu and Kashmir , India .

The Mesozoic was a time of significant tectonic , climate and evolutionary activity . The era witnessed the gradual rifting of the supercontinent Pangaea into separate landmasses that would eventually move into their current positions . The climate of the Mesozoic was varied , alternating between warming and cooling periods . Overall , however , the Earth was hotter than it is today . Dinosaurs appeared in the Late Triassic and became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates early in the Jurassic , occupying this position for about 135 million years until their demise at the end of the Cretaceous . Birds first appeared in the Jurassic , having evolved from a branch of theropod dinosaurs . The first mammals also appeared during the Mesozoic , but would remain small -- less than 15 kg ( 33 lb ) -- until the Cenozoic . </P>", "<P> In the film , Sinatra sings the title song .

He made the game - winning jump shot in the 1982 NCAA Championship game against Georgetown , which was led by future NBA rival Patrick Ewing . Jordan later described this shot as the major turning point in his basketball career . During his three seasons at North Carolina , he averaged 17.7 ppg on 54.0 % shooting , and added 5.0 rebounds per game ( rpg ) . He was selected by consensus to the NCAA All - American First Team in both his sophomore ( 1983 ) and junior ( 1984 ) seasons . After winning the Naismith and the Wooden College Player of the Year awards in 1984 , Jordan left North Carolina one year before his scheduled graduation to enter the 1984 NBA draft . The Chicago Bulls selected Jordan with the third overall pick , after Hakeem Olajuwon ( Houston Rockets ) and Sam Bowie ( Portland Trail Blazers ) . One of the primary reasons why Jordan was not drafted sooner was because the first two teams were in need of a center . However , Trail Blazers general manager Stu Inman contended that it was not a matter of drafting a center , but more a matter of taking Sam Bowie over Jordan , in part because Portland already had Clyde Drexler , who was a guard with similar skills to Jordan . ESPN , citing Bowie 's injury - laden college career , named the Blazers ' choice of Bowie as the worst draft pick in North American professional sports history . Jordan returned to North Carolina to complete his degree in 1986 . He graduated the same year with a Bachelor of Arts degree in geography . </P>", "<P> The Breakers is a Vanderbilt mansion located on Ochre Point Avenue , Newport , Rhode Island , United States .

The salt concentration is usually expressed in parts per thousand ( permille , \u2030 ) or parts per million ( ppm ) . The United States Geological Survey classifies saline water in three salinity categories . Salt concentration in slightly saline water is around 1,000 to 3,000 ppm ( 0.1 -- 0.3 % ) , in moderately saline water 3,000 to 10,000 ppm ( 0.3 -- 1 % ) and in highly saline water 10,000 to 35,000 ppm ( 1 -- 3.5 % ) . Seawater has a salinity of roughly 35,000 ppm , equivalent to 35 grams of salt per one liter ( or kilogram ) of water . The saturation level is dependent on the temperature of the water . At 20 \u00b0 C one milliliter of water can dissolve about 0.357 grams of salt ; a concentration of 26.3 % . At boiling ( 100 \u00b0 C ) the amount that can be dissolved in one milliliter of water increases to about 0.391 grams or 28.1 % saline solution . </P>", "<P> Meanwhile , with Ralph missing , his game is labelled as malfunctioning and faces being unplugged .

The arrangement transpired after a bargain for his blood that would cure Damon of the werewolf bite he had received from Tyler . At first , he is reluctant to involve Elena in the rescue attempts , employing Alaric Saltzman , Elena 's guardian , instead as Klaus does not know that Elena is alive after the sacrifice which frees Klaus ' hybrid side . However , Elena involves herself , desperate to find Stefan . Damon , though hesitant at first , is unable to refuse her because of his love for her . He also points out to her that she once turned back from finding Stefan since she knew Damon would be in danger , clearly showing that she also has feelings for him . He tells her that `` when ( he ) drag ( s ) ( his ) brother from the edge to deliver him back to ( her ) , ( he ) wants her to remember the things ( she ) felt while he was gone . '' When Stefan finally returns to Mystic Falls , his attitude is different from that of the first and second seasons . This causes a rift between Elena and Stefan whereas the relationship between Damon and Elena becomes closer and more intimate . A still loyal Elena , however , refuses to admit her feelings for Damon . In ' Dangerous Liaisons ' , Elena , frustrated with her feelings for him , tells Damon that his love for her may be a problem , and that this could be causing all their troubles . This incenses Damon , causing him to revert to the uncaring and reckless Damon seen in the previous seasons . The rocky relationship between the two continues until the sexual tension hits the fan and in a moment of heated passion , Elena -- for the first time in the three seasons -- kisses Damon of her own accord . This kiss finally causes Elena to admit that she loves both brothers and realize that she must ultimately make her choice as her own ancestress , Katherine Pierce , who turned the brothers , once did . In assessment of her feelings for Damon , she states this : `` Damon just sort of snuck up on me . He got under my skin and no matter what I do , I ca n't shake him . '' In the season finale , a trip designed to get her to safety forces Elena to make her choice : to go to Damon and possibly see him one last time ; or to go to Stefan and her friends and see them one last time . She chooses the latter when she calls Damon to tell him her decision . Damon , who is trying to stop Alaric , accepts what she says and she tells him that maybe if she had met Damon before she had met Stefan , her choice may have been different . This statement causes Damon to remember the first night he did meet Elena which was , in fact , the night her parents died - before she had met Stefan . Not wanting anyone to know he was in town and after giving her some advice about life and love , Damon compels her to forget . He remembers this as he fights Alaric and seems accepting of his death when Alaric , whose life line is tied to Elena 's , suddenly collapses in his arms . Damon is grief - stricken , knowing that this means that Elena has also died and yells , `` No ! You are not dead ! '' A heartbroken Damon then goes to the hospital demanding to see Elena when the doctor , Meredith Fell , tells him that she gave Elena vampire blood .

Spherical mirrors , however , suffer from spherical aberration -- parallel rays reflected from such mirrors do not focus to a single point . For parallel rays , such as those coming from a very distant object , a parabolic reflector can do a better job . Such a mirror can focus incoming parallel rays to a much smaller spot than a spherical mirror can .

The phloem pressure can rise to several MPa , far higher than atmospheric pressure . Selective inter-connection between these systems allows this high solute concentration in the phloem to draw xylem fluid upwards by negative pressure . </Li> <Li> Transpirational pull : Similarly , the evaporation of water from the surfaces of mesophyll cells to the atmosphere also creates a negative pressure at the top of a plant . This causes millions of minute menisci to form in the mesophyll cell wall . The resulting surface tension causes a negative pressure or tension in the xylem that pulls the water from the roots and soil . </Li> <Li> Root pressure : If the water potential of the root cells is more negative than that of the soil , usually due to high concentrations of solute , water can move by osmosis into the root from the soil . This causes a positive pressure that forces sap up the xylem towards the leaves . In some circumstances , the sap will be forced from the leaf through a hydathode in a phenomenon known as guttation . Root pressure is highest in the morning before the stomata open and allow transpiration to begin . Different plant species can have different root pressures even in a similar environment ; examples include up to 145 kPa in Vitis riparia but around zero in Celastrus orbiculatus . </Li> </Ul>", "<P> Deprived of the element of surprise , Sosa 's gunmen directly attack Tony 's mansion .

He was the son of the river god Cephissus and nymph Liriope . He was proud , in that he disdained those who loved him . Nemesis noticed this behavior and attracted Narcissus to a pool , where he saw his own reflection in the water and fell in love with it , not realizing it was merely an image . Unable to leave the beauty of his reflection , Narcissus lost his will to live . He stared at his reflection until he died . Narcissus is the origin of the term narcissism , a fixation with oneself and one 's physical appearance or public perception . </P>", "<P> The Spurs finished the 1995 -- 96 season under Hill at 59 -- 23 and lost in the Western Conference semi-finals . Few observers could have predicted how far the Spurs would fall during the 1996 -- 97 season , especially with the signing of Dominique Wilkins . Robinson missed the first month of the season due to a back injury . He returned in December , but played only six games before a broken foot sidelined him for the rest of the season . Elliott also missed more than half the season due to injury . Without Robinson and Elliott , the Spurs were a rudderless team . The lone bright spot was Wilkins , leading the team in scoring with an average of 18.2 ppg . The Spurs ended the season with a 20 -- 62 record , the worst in franchise history -- and to date , the last time they have missed the playoffs . Hill only lasted 18 games as coach that season , eventually being fired and replaced by general manager Gregg Popovich , who had also served a stint under Brown as an assistant coach . Wilkins would play his lone season in 1996 -- 97 for San Antonio , knowing his minutes and playing time would greatly diminish next season . </P>", "<P> The home of James and Nancy Bennett , simple yeoman farmers , served as the site of the surrender negotiations between Major General William T.

The Roman Empire lost the strengths that had allowed it to exercise effective control ; modern historians mention factors including the effectiveness and numbers of the army , the health and numbers of the Roman population , the strength of the economy , the competence of the Emperor , the religious changes of the period , and the efficiency of the civil administration . Increasing pressure from barbarians outside Roman culture also contributed greatly to the collapse .

It features a Lyricon solo by saxophonist Tom Scott , though Captain mimed to this part on a descant recorder in the promotional video . Even though an edited version was released as a single , yet another version was created for their many TV performances promoting the song . This version contained a `` natural '' ending , opposed to the fade - out ending that was featured on the single and album versions . This version was mainly lip - synced by Tennille on such TV programs . </P>", "<P> Kelly played Laurie Forman , the older sister of Eric Forman , on That ' 70s Show .

Bland ( 1854 -- 1911 ) , an African American who wrote over 700 songs . It is not an adaption by Bland of the `` Carry Me Back to Old Virginia '' by the Christy Minstrels , also known by the title ; `` Floating Scow of Old Virginny '' , a song copyrighted by Edwin Pearce Christy in 1847 . Bland simply appropriated the song title . Bland 's song bears no resemblance to it melodically , harmonically , or in the lyrics ( except that both songs are minstrel songs ) . The latter song was very popular during the California gold rush and the American Civil War . Many parodies were written on this melody and became popular with miners , Civil War soldiers and civilians . Bland 's version , the best known , was written in 1878 when many newly - freed slaves were struggling to find work . The song has become controversial in modern times , with critics viewing the lyrics as racially insensitive . </P>", "<P> Both male and female mallards have distinct iridescent purple - blue speculum feathers edged with white , which are prominent in flight or at rest but temporarily shed during the annual summer moult . Upon hatching , the plumage of the duckling is yellow on the underside and face ( with streaks by the eyes ) and black on the back ( with some yellow spots ) all the way to the top and back of the head . Its legs and bill are also black . As it nears a month in age , the duckling 's plumage starts becoming drab , looking more like the female , though more streaked , and its legs lose their dark grey colouring . Two months after hatching , the fledgling period has ended , and the duckling is now a juvenile . Between three and four months of age , the juvenile can finally begin flying , as its wings are fully developed for flight ( which can be confirmed by the sight of purple speculum feathers ) . Its bill soon loses its dark grey colouring , and its sex can finally be distinguished visually by three factors : 1 ) the bill is yellow in males , but black and orange in females ; 2 ) the breast feathers are reddish - brown in males , but brown in females ; and 3 ) in males , the centre tail feather ( drake feather ) is curled , but in females , the centre tail feather is straight . During the final period of maturity leading up to adulthood ( 6 -- 10 months of age ) , the plumage of female juveniles remains the same while the plumage of male juveniles gradually changes to its characteristic colours . This change in plumage also applies to adult mallard males when they transition in and out of their non-breeding eclipse plumage at the beginning and the end of the summer moulting period . The adulthood age for mallards is fourteen months , and the average life expectancy is three years , but they can live to twenty . </P>", "<P> Based on the terms of the Treaty of Tordesillas , the Portuguese Crown claimed it had territorial rights in the area visited by the Genoese explorer John Cabot in 1497 and 1498 on behalf of the Crown of England . To that end , in 1499 and 1500 , the Portuguese mariner Jo\u00e3o Fernandes Lavrador visited the northeast Atlantic coast and Greenland , which accounts for the appearance of `` Labrador '' on topographical maps of the period . Subsequently , in 1501 and 1502 , the Corte - Real brothers explored and charted Greenland and what is today the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador , claiming these lands as part of the Portuguese Empire . Fragmentary evidence also suggests a previous expedition in 1473 by Jo\u00e3o Vaz Corte - Real , their father , with other Europeans , to Terra Nova do Bacalhau ( Newfoundland of the Codfish ) in North America . The possible voyage of 1473 and several other possible pre-Columbian expeditions to North America in the 15th century , mostly from the Azores in the case of the Portuguese ( included in donation royal letters ) , remain matters of great controversy for scholars . Their existence is based on brief or fragmentary historical documents that are unclear concerning the destinations of voyages . </P>", "<P> The Mickey Mouse Club is an American variety television show that aired intermittently from 1955 to 1996 and returned in 2017 to social media .

The voice of Barney Rubble was provided by voice actor Mel Blanc , though five episodes during the second season ( the first , second , fifth , sixth , and ninth ) employed Hanna - Barbera regular Daws Butler while Blanc was incapacitated by a near - fatal car accident . Blanc was able to return to the series much sooner than expected , by virtue of a temporary recording studio for the entire cast set up at Blanc 's bedside . Blanc 's portrayal of Barney had changed considerably after the accident . In the earliest episodes , Blanc had used a much higher pitch to the point of portraying Barney as a smart - aleck . After his recovery from the accident , Blanc used a deeper voice , quite similar to the voice of the Abominable Snowman he performed in other cartoons , and was shown as somewhat dopier than before . </P>", "<P> Tuesdays with Morrie is a book about Morrie and a former student of his , Mitch Albom .

Most of the ATP produced by aerobic cellular respiration is made by oxidative phosphorylation . This works by the energy released in the consumption of pyruvate being used to create a chemiosmotic potential by pumping protons across a membrane . This potential is then used to drive ATP synthase and produce ATP from ADP and a phosphate group . Biology textbooks often state that 38 ATP molecules can be made per oxidised glucose molecule during cellular respiration ( 2 from glycolysis , 2 from the Krebs cycle , and about 34 from the electron transport system ) . However , this maximum yield is never quite reached because of losses due to leaky membranes as well as the cost of moving pyruvate and ADP into the mitochondrial matrix , and current estimates range around 29 to 30 ATP per glucose . </P>", "<P> For the 2011 season , the park added a large Daktronics HD screen nicknamed `` El Grande '' replacing the original one in center field .

The reactions involved in respiration are catabolic reactions , which break large molecules into smaller ones , releasing energy in the process , as weak so - called `` high - energy '' bonds are replaced by stronger bonds in the products . Respiration is one of the key ways a cell releases chemical energy to fuel cellular activity . Cellular respiration is considered an exothermic redox reaction which releases heat . The overall reaction occurs in a series of biochemical steps , most of which are redox reactions themselves . Although cellular respiration is technically a combustion reaction , it clearly does not resemble one when it occurs in a living cell because of the slow release of energy from the series of reactions . </P>", "<P> The Black Death was a bubonic plague pandemic , which reached England in June 1348 .

The court surface is raised above the ground approximately two feet so that players ' benches , officials tables , etc. , are actually below the court . The same goes for fans with the first row looking at players at about knee - level . Normally , other than the officials and those players actively playing , only head coaches are allowed to be on the court itself . The raised floor is one of only a few remaining examples left and contributes significantly to the historic aura of the 80 - year - old arena . This served as the inspiration for the NCAA Men 's Division I Basketball Championship to host stadiums for their Final Four as of 2009 to have the floor about three feet off the stadium floor as part of an increased capacity to a minimum of 70,000 . The floor in Williams Arena recently underwent a replacement . PCL Construction began work on May 11 , 2009 , replacing the original playing surface from 1928 with a new floor along with new basketball goals . This was the first major upgrade to the facility since a renovation occurred in the early 1990s . Memorial Gymnasium at Vanderbilt University and Hinkle Fieldhouse at Butler University are two other existing arenas with a raised floor . Robertson Memorial Field House at Bradley University , since demolished , also used a raised floor . </P>", "<P> Much of the shuttle was covered with LI - 900 silica tiles , made from essentially very pure quartz sand .

Social contract arguments typically posit that individuals have consented , either explicitly or tacitly , to surrender some of their freedoms and submit to the authority of the ruler or magistrate ( or to the decision of a majority ) , in exchange for protection of their remaining rights . The question of the relation between natural and legal rights , therefore , is often an aspect of social contract theory . The term takes its name from The Social Contract ( Du contrat social ou Principes du droit politique ) , a 1762 book by Jean - Jacques Rousseau that discussed this concept . </P>", "<P> The small budget dictated much of the production process .

The song was released as the lead single from Welcome Interstate Managers on September 29 , 2003 through S - Curve Records and Virgin Records . `` Stacy 's Mom '' was written by bassist Adam Schlesinger and vocalist Chris Collingwood , both of whom produced the song alongside Mike Denneen . Its subject matter was inspired by a friend of Schlesinger 's when he was young who had a crush on his grandmother . A power pop song , the group hoped to emulate the sound of The Cars with the track . </P>", "<P> Tropical rainforests are rainforests that occur in areas of tropical rainforest climate in which there is no dry season -- all months have an average precipitation of at least 60 mm -- and may also be referred to as lowland equatorial evergreen rainforest . True rainforests are typically found between 10 degrees north and south of the equator ( see map ) ; they are a sub-set of the tropical forest biome that occurs roughly within the 28 degree latitudes ( in the equatorial zone between the Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn ) . Within the World Wildlife Fund 's biome classification , tropical rainforests are a type of tropical moist broadleaf forest ( or tropical wet forest ) that also includes the more extensive seasonal tropical forests . </P>", "<P> John Stafford Smith ( 30 March 1750 -- 21 September 1836 ) was a British composer , church organist , and early musicologist .

Most of government , industry and commerce use metric units , but imperial units are officially used to specify journey distances , vehicle speeds and the sizes of returnable milk containers , beer and cider glasses ( though fresh milk is often still sold in multiples of pints , with the metric equivalent also marked ) . Imperial units are also often used to describe body measurements and vehicle fuel economy . In schools metric units are taught and used as the norm and imperial units that remain in common usage in the UK must also be taught . </P>", "<P> In probability theory , two events are independent , statistically independent , or stochastically independent if the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of occurrence of the other .

It was widely praised as better than the first season , particularly for its narrative and cast -- Woodard 's performance especially -- though there was again some criticism for its pacing . </P>", "<P> The series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton , Pennsylvania , branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company .

L. 93 -- 618 , 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2411 ) authorizes the President to take all appropriate action , including retaliation , to obtain the removal of any act , policy , or practice of a foreign government that violates an international trade agreement or is unjustified , unreasonable , or discriminatory , and that burdens or restricts U.S. commerce . Section 301 cases can be self - initiated by the United States Trade Representative ( USTR ) or as the result of a petition filed by a firm or industry group . If USTR initiates a Section 301 investigation , it must seek to negotiate a settlement with the foreign country in the form of compensation or elimination of the trade barrier . For cases involving trade agreements , the USTR is required to request formal dispute proceedings as provided by the trade agreements . The law does not require that the U.S. government wait until it receives authorization from the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) to take enforcement actions , and the President is increasingly focused on enforcing intellectual property ( IP ) rights ( under Agreements that may be outside of the WTO ) under the `` Special '' 301 amendments but the U.S. has committed itself to pursuing the resolution of disputes under WTO agreements through the WTO dispute settlement mechanism , which has its own timetable . </P>", "<P> The Gulf War ( 2 August 1990 -- 28 February 1991 ) , codenamed Operation Desert Shield ( 2 August 1990 -- 17 January 1991 ) for operations leading to the buildup of troops and defense of Saudi Arabia and Operation Desert Storm ( 17 January 1991 -- 28 February 1991 ) in its combat phase , was a war waged by coalition forces from 35 nations led by the United States against Iraq in response to Iraq 's invasion and annexation of Kuwait . </P>", "<P> The deadliest war in history , in terms of the cumulative number of deaths since its start , is World War II , from 1939 to 1945 , with 60 -- 85 million deaths , followed by the Mongol conquests at up to 60 million . As concerns a belligerent 's losses in proportion to its prewar population , the most destructive war in modern history may have been the Paraguayan War ( see Paraguayan War casualties ) . In 2013 war resulted in 31,000 deaths , down from 72,000 deaths in 1990 . In 2003 , Richard Smalley identified war as the sixth ( of ten ) biggest problem facing humanity for the next fifty years . War usually results in significant deterioration of infrastructure and the ecosystem , a decrease in social spending , famine , large - scale emigration from the war zone , and often the mistreatment of prisoners of war or civilians . For instance , of the nine million people who were on the territory of the Byelorussian SSR in 1941 , some 1.6 million were killed by the Germans in actions away from battlefields , including about 700,000 prisoners of war , 500,000 Jews , and 320,000 people counted as partisans ( the vast majority of whom were unarmed civilians ) . Another byproduct of some wars is the prevalence of propaganda by some or all parties in the conflict , and increased revenues by weapons manufacturers . </P>", "<P> The terms of the new agreement ended the practice of drafting high school players , starting in the 2006 Draft .

For most of his time on the series , Greene 's role was that of a mediator and occasional authority figure , and he was considered the main character of the series for the first eight seasons . Mark was also the only original character to die , and his death at the end of Season 8 marked one of the biggest turning points in the series . </P>", "<P> The surname Ruiz originates from the Germanic personal name `` Hrodric '' which is composed of the elements Hrod , meaning `` renown '' , and Ric meaning power . Thus , the name Ruiz means `` famous ruler '' . Ruiz derives from the name of the father of the original bearer . Its roots can be traced back to the Visigoths , the Germanic tribe who ruled in the Iberian Peninsula between the 5th and 8th centuries . </P>", "<P> The 2022 FIFA World Cup is scheduled to be the 22nd edition of the FIFA World Cup , the quadrennial international men 's football championship contested by the national teams of the member associations of FIFA .

In addition the tournament will be the last to involve 32 teams , with an increase to 48 teams scheduled for the 2026 tournament . </P>", "<P> In those who are low risk , the risk of death for caesarean sections is 13 per 100,000 and for vaginal birth 3.5 per 100,000 in the developed world . The United Kingdom National Health Service gives the risk of death for the mother as three times that of a vaginal birth but it is important to remember the actual risk of death in either situation is extremely small in resource - rich settings . </P>", "<P> Eight - year - old Princess Irene lives a lonely life in a castle in a wild , desolate , mountainous kingdom , with only her nursemaid , Lootie , for company . Her father , the king , is normally absent , and her mother is dead . Unknown to her , the nearby mines are inhabited by a race of goblins , long banished from the kingdom and now anxious to take revenge on their human neighbours . One rainy day , the princess explores the castle and discovers a beautiful , mysterious lady , who identifies herself as Irene 's namesake and great - great - grandmother . The next day , Princess Irene persuades her nursemaid to take her outside . After dark they are chased by goblins and rescued by the young miner , Curdie , whom Irene befriends . At work with the rest of the miners , Curdie overhears the goblins talking , and their conversation reveals to Curdie the secret weakness of goblin anatomy : they have very soft , vulnerable feet . Curdie sneaks into the Great Hall of the goblin palace to eavesdrop on their general meeting , and hears that the goblins intend to flood the mine if a certain other part of their plan should fail . He later conveys this news to his father . In the palace , Princess Irene injures her hand , which her great - great - grandmother heals . A week later Irene is about to see her great - great - grandmother again , but is frightened by a long - legged cat and escapes up the mountain ; whereupon the light from her great - great - grandmother 's tower leads her home , where her great - great - grandmother gives Irene a ring attached to a thread invisible except to herself , which thereafter connects her constantly to home . </P>", "<P> The Louvre Pyramid ( Pyramide du Louvre ) is a large glass and metal pyramid designed by Chinese - American architect I.M.

The large pyramid serves as the main entrance to the Louvre Museum . Completed in 1989 , it has become a landmark of the city of Paris . </P>", "<P> The second Persian invasion of Greece ( 480 -- 479 BC ) occurred during the Greco - Persian Wars , as King Xerxes I of Persia sought to conquer all of Greece . The invasion was a direct , if delayed , response to the defeat of the first Persian invasion of Greece ( 492 -- 490 BC ) at the Battle of Marathon , which ended Darius I 's attempts to subjugate Greece . After Darius 's death , his son Xerxes spent several years planning for the second invasion , mustering an enormous army and navy . The Athenians and Spartans led the Greek resistance . About a tenth of the Greek city - states joined the ' Allied ' effort ; most remained neutral or submitted to Xerxes . </P>", "<Table> <Tr> <Th> Language </Th> <Th> Usual Responses and Notes </Th> <Th> Response Meaning in English </Th> <Th> Sneezer Reply and Pronunciation </Th> <Th> Reply Meaning in English </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Albanian </Td> <Td> Sh\u00ebndet ( shuhn - det ) </Td> <Td> `` Health !

This version of Mordo is a combination of different characters from the Doctor Strange mythos , and unlike in the comics is not introduced as villainous . Ejiofor noted this , calling Mordo `` a very complex character that , really , I do n't think can be nailed down either way '' . Director Scott Derrickson added that the change in character stemmed from casting Ejiofor and conversations the director had with him . Ejiofor described Mordo 's relationship with the Ancient One as `` long and intense '' , while noting a `` growing respect '' between the character and Strange , until `` things get complicated '' . Derrickson felt Mordo was a fundamentalist , saying `` When someone gives themselves over to an extraordinarily strict moral code , the process of breaking out of that is a violent one . He becomes disillusioned with the Ancient One 's ( moral contradictions ) . The difference is Strange can accept that contradiction . Mordo can not cope with it , '' which leads to the `` antagonism between Mordo and Strange '' to explore in future films . Discussing the diversity of the film 's cast when addressing the casting of the controversial characters the Ancient One and Wong , Derrickson was confident that the decision to cast Ejiofor as Mordo , and thus changing the character `` from white to black '' , was the right one to make . </Li>", "<P> The Philippines ' Department of Science and Technology ( abbreviated as DOST ; Filipino : Kagawaran ng Agham at Teknolohiya ) , is the executive department of the Philippine Government responsible for the coordination of science and technology - related projects in the Philippines and to formulate policies and projects in the fields of science and technology in support of national development . </P>", "<P> The military history of the United States in World War II covers the war against Germany , Italy , Japan and starting with the 7 December 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor .

The movie 's original plot was written by Yuichi Shinbo who also came up with the new characters ' names . From there , director Kazuya Murata did research on Spain to develop Table City , intended as a contrast to Amestris , which was based on England . Because it was the only time in the series that the main characters traveled to another country , Murata had difficulties concluding it , wondering if it would affect the overarching storyline . Therefore , the story was set during the time Edward realized Alphonse 's human body existed somewhere , with the logic that knowledge would encourage him to travel to another area to do research . ( This likely places the events of the film somewhere around episode 21 of Brotherhood . Alphonse has learned to transmute with only his hands , but Mustang 's subordinates have not yet been split up , definitively placing it somewhere between episodes 15 and 24 . ) Hiromu Arakawa was not included as part of the staff but was still looking forward to the film . </P>", "<P> The main provisions of the Act are to extend the scope of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 , to create an Ombudsman scheme , and to increase the powers of the Office of Fair Trading in relation to consumer credit .

Between 1969 and 1980 , imported Dogues de Bordeaux in the USA were scarce , limited to a few breeders who worked closely with the French Dogue de Bordeaux Club , the SADB . The breed was first `` officially '' introduced to American purebred enthusiasts in an article written in 1982 and by the American anthropologist , Dr. Carl Semencic for `` Dog World '' magazine . That article , entitled `` Introducing the Dogue de Bordeaux '' , was followed by chapters dedicated to the Dogue in Semencic 's books on dogs , published by T.F.H. Publications of Neptune , New Jersey . When Semencic 's first article on the breed was published , there were no Bordeaux Dogues in the United States . There were 600 examples left in the world , mostly in France , the Netherlands and East Berlin , and the breed 's numbers were on the decline .

These guidelines provide minimum requirements that a manufacturer must meet to assure that their products are consistently high in quality , from batch to batch , for their intended use . The rules that govern each industry may differ significantly ; however , the main purpose of GMP is always to prevent harm from occurring to the end user . Additional tenets include ensuring the end product is free from contamination , that it is consistent in its manufacture , that its manufacture has been well documented , that personnel are well trained , and the product has been checked for quality more than just at the end phase . GMP is typically ensured through the effective use of a quality management system ( QMS ) . </P>", "<P> North Korea shares a border with three countries ; China along the Amnok River , Russia along the Tumen River , and South Korea along the Korean Demilitarized Zone ( DMZ ) .

There are four stages of the spinal cord that arises from the neural tube : The neural plate , neural fold , neural tube , and the spinal cord . Neural differentiation occurs within the spinal cord portion of the tube . As the neural tube begins to develop , the notochord begins to secrete a factor known as Sonic hedgehog or SHH . As a result , the floor plate then also begins to secrete SHH , and this will induce the basal plate to develop motor neurons . During the maturation of the neural tube , its lateral walls thicken and form a longtitudinal groove called the sulcus limitans . This extends the length of the spinal cord into dorsal and ventral portions as well . Meanwhile , the overlying ectoderm secretes bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP ) . This induces the roof plate to begin to secrete BMP , which will induce the alar plate to develop sensory neurons . Opposing gradients of such morphogens as BMP and SHH form different domains of dividing cells along the dorsal ventral axis . Dorsal root ganglion neurons differentiate from neural crest progenitors . As the dorsal and ventral column cells proliferate , the lumen of the neural tube narrows to form the small central canal of the spinal cord . The alar plate and the basal plate are separated by the sulcus limitans . Additionally , the floor plate also secretes netrins . The netrins act as chemoattractants to decussation of pain and temperature sensory neurons in the alar plate across the anterior white commissure , where they then ascend towards the thalamus . Following the closure of the caudal neuropore and formation of the brain 's ventricles that contain the choroid plexus tissue , the central canal of the caudal spinal cord is filled with cerebrospinal fluid . </P>", "<P> An example of spheres of influence was China in the late 19th and early 20th Century , when Britain , France , Germany , and Russia ( later replaced by Japan ) had de facto control over large swaths of territory .

A set of five nitrogenous bases is used in the construction of nucleotides , which in turn build up the nucleic acids like DNA and RNA . These nitrogenous bases are adenine ( A ) , uracil ( U ) , guanine ( G ) , thymine ( T ) , and cytosine ( C ) . These nitrogenous bases hydrogen bond between opposing DNA strands to form the rungs of the `` twisted ladder '' or double helix of DNA or a biological catalyst that is found in the nucleotides . Adenine is always paired with thymine , and guanine is always paired with cytosine . These are known as base pairs . Uracil is only present in RNA , replacing thymine . Pyrimidines include thymine , cytosine , and uracil . They have a single ring structure . Purines include adenine and guanine .

The castles were built by the more powerful lords of Anjou in the late 10th and 11th centuries , in particular Fulk III and his son , Geoffrey II , who built a great number of them between 987 and 1060 . Many of these earliest castles would have appeared quite crude and rustic by later standards , belying the power and prestige of their builders . William the Conqueror , as the Duke of Normandy , is believed to have adopted the motte - and - bailey design from neighbouring Anjou . Duke William went on to prohibit the building of castles without his consent through the Consuetudines et Justicie , with his legal definition of castles centring on the classic motte - and - bailey features of ditching , banking and palisading . </P>", "<P> Naomi Grossman ( born February 6 , 1975 ) is an American actress , writer , and producer best known for her role as Pepper in the second and fourth seasons of the FX horror television series American Horror Story . </P>", "<P> The SDLC is not a methodology per se , but rather a description of the phases in the life cycle of a software application . These phases ( broadly speaking ) are , investigation , analysis , design , build , test , implement , and maintenance and support . All software development methodologies ( such as the more commonly known waterfall and scrum methodologies ) follow the SDLC phases but the method of doing that varies vastly between methodologies . In the Scrum methodology , for example , one could say a single user story goes through all the phases of the SDLC within a single two - week sprint . Contrast this to the waterfall methodology , as another example , where every business requirement ( recorded in the analysis phase of the SDLC in a document called the Business Requirements Specification ) is translated into feature / functional descriptions ( recorded in the design phase in a document called the Functional Specification ) which are then all built in one go as a collection of solution features typically over a period of three to nine months , or more . These methodologies are obviously quite different approaches yet , they both contain the SDLC phases in which a requirement is born , then travels through the life cycle phases ending in the final phase of maintenance and support , after - which ( typically ) the whole life cycle starts again for a subsequent version of the software application . </P>", "<P> Ant - Man and the Wasp is a 2018 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics characters Scott Lang / Ant - Man and Hope van Dyne / Wasp . Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures , it is the sequel to 2015 's Ant - Man , and the twentieth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe ( MCU ) . The film is directed by Peyton Reed and written by the writing teams of Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers , and Paul Rudd , Andrew Barrer , and Gabriel Ferrari .

'' Harris , David Dastmalchian , Hannah John - Kamen , Abby Ryder Fortson , Randall Park , Michelle Pfeiffer , Laurence Fishburne , and Michael Douglas . In Ant - Man and the Wasp , the titular pair work with Hank Pym to retrieve Janet van Dyne from the quantum realm . </P>", "<P> An American Girl : Isabelle Dances Into the Spotlight ( 2014 ) is the eighth film in the American Girl series , starring Erin Pitt as Isabelle Palmer , along with Melora Hardin , Grace Davidson as Jade Palmer , Devyn Nekoda as Luisa , Genneya Walton as Renata , Alyssa Trask as Emma , Avery Trask as Hip Hop Dancer , Daniel Fathers , Kolton Stewart , Mathew Edmondson , and Saara Chaudry . The screenplay was written by Jessica O'Toole and Amy Rardin . The movie was directed by Vince Marcello . </P>", "<P> The Mexican Revolution ( Spanish : Revoluci\u00f3n Mexicana ) also known as the Mexican Civil War ( Spanish : Guerra civil mexicana ) was a major armed struggle , lasting roughly from 1910 to 1920 , that radically transformed Mexican culture and government . Although recent research has focused on local and regional aspects of the Revolution , it was a `` genuinely national revolution '' . Its outbreak in 1910 resulted from the failure of the 35 - year - long regime of Porfirio D\u00edaz to find a managed solution to the presidential succession . This meant there was a political crisis among competing elites and the opportunity for agrarian insurrection . Wealthy landowner Francisco I. Madero challenged D\u00edaz in the 1910 presidential election , and following the rigged results , revolted under the Plan of San Luis Potos\u00ed . Armed conflict ousted D\u00edaz from power ; a new election was held in 1911 , bringing Madero to the presidency . </P>", "<P> Jackknifing refers to the folding of an articulated vehicle i.e. one towing a trailer , such that it resembles the acute angle of a folding pocket knife . If a vehicle towing a trailer skids , the trailer can push the towing vehicle from behind until it spins the vehicle around and faces backwards . This may be caused by equipment failure , improper braking , or adverse road conditions such as an icy road surface . In extreme circumstances , a driver may attempt to jackknife the vehicle deliberately in order to halt it following brake failure . A jackknife event of a heavy vehicle can be fatal to the driver as the top of the cab can be crushed or sliced off as it swings round violently and tries to fold under the trailer . </P>", "<P> `` Twelfth Night '' is a reference to the twelfth night after Christmas Day , called the Eve of the Feast of Epiphany . It was originally a Catholic holiday and therefore , like other Christian feast days , an occasion for revelry . Servants often dressed up as their masters , men as women and so forth . This history of festive ritual and Carnivalesque reversal , based on the ancient Roman festival of Saturnalia at the same time of year ( characterized by drunken revelry and inversion of the social order ; masters became slaves for a day , and vice versa ) , is the cultural origin of the play 's gender confusion - driven plot . The actual Elizabethan festival of Twelfth Night would involve the antics of a Lord of Misrule , who before leaving his temporary position of authority , would call for entertainment , songs and mummery ; the play has been regarded as preserving this festive and traditional atmosphere of licensed disorder . This leads to the general inversion of the order of things , most notably gender roles . The embittered and isolated Malvolio can be regarded as an adversary of festive enjoyment and community , led by Sir Toby Belch , `` the vice-regent spokesman for cakes and ale '' and his partner in a comic stock duo , the simple and constantly exploited Sir Andrew Aguecheek . </P>", "<P> El Pollo Loco , Inc. is a restaurant chain based in the United States , specializing in Mexican - style grilled chicken . Restaurant service consists of : dine - in , take - out , with some locations offering drive through options . The company is headquartered in Costa Mesa , California and operates over 400 ( as of March 2014 ) company - owned and franchised restaurants in the Southwestern United States . `` El Pollo Loco '' is Spanish for `` The Crazy Chicken '' . </P>", "<P> The legislative body , which went by various names from colony to colony and through time , was elected by the enfranchised voters . By 1755 , most free white men could vote . In colonial New England there were annual town meetings , where each colonist had a voice . </P>", "<P> In 1947 , the Dodgers called Robinson up to the major leagues six days before the start of the season . With Eddie Stanky entrenched at second base for the Dodgers , Robinson played his initial major league season as a first baseman . On April 15 , Robinson made his major league debut at the relatively advanced age of 28 at Ebbets Field before a crowd of 26,623 spectators , more than 14,000 of whom were black . Although he failed to get a base hit , he walked and scored a run in the Dodgers ' 5 -- 3 victory . Robinson became the first player since 1880 to openly break the major league baseball color line . Black fans began flocking to see the Dodgers when they came to town , abandoning their Negro league teams . </P>", "<P> The giant anteater is the most terrestrial of the living anteater species . Its ancestors may originally have been adapted to arboreal life ; the transition to life on the ground could have been aided by the expansion of open habitats such as savanna in South America and the availability there of colonial insects , such as termites , that provided a larger potential food source . Both the giant anteater and the southern tamandua are well represented in the fossil record of the late Pleistocene and early Holocene . </P>", "<P> North Korea 's foreign trade deteriorated in the 1990s . After hitting the bottom of $1.4 billion in 1998 , it recovered slightly . North Korea 's trade total in 2002 was $2.7 billion : only about 50 % of $5.2 billion in 1988 , even in nominal US dollars . These figures exclude intra-Korean trade , deemed internal , which rose in 2002 to $641 million . During the late 2000s trade grew strongly , almost tripling between 2007 and 2011 to $5.6 billion , with much of the growth being with China . By about 2010 external trade had returned to 1990 levels , and by 2014 was near double 1990 levels , alongside trade with China increasing from 50 % of total trade in 2005 to near 90 % in 2014 . </P>", "<P> Astragalus is a large genus of about 4,200 species of herbs and small shrubs , belonging to the legume family Fabaceae and the subfamily Faboideae . It is the largest genus of plants in terms of described species . The genus is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere . Common names include milkvetch ( most species ) , locoweed ( in North America , some species ) and goat 's - thorn ( A. gummifer , A. tragacanthus ) . Some pale - flowered vetches are similar in appearance , but vetches are more vine - like . </P>", "<P> The Mesozoic Era ( / \u02ccm\u025bs\u0259\u02c8zo\u028a\u026ak , \u02ccmi\u02d0 - , - so\u028a - / or / \u02ccm\u025bz\u0259\u02c8zo\u028a\u026ak , \u02ccmi\u02d0 - , - so\u028a - / ) is an interval of geological time from about 252 to 66 million years ago . It is also called the Age of Reptiles , a phrase introduced by the 19th century paleontologist Gideon Mantell who viewed it as dominated by diapsids such as Iguanodon , Megalosaurus , Plesiosaurus and Pterodactylus . This Era is also called from a paleobotanist view the Age of Conifers . </P>", "<P> When Calls the Heart tells the story of Elizabeth Thatcher ( Erin Krakow ) , a young teacher accustomed to her high - society life . She receives her first classroom assignment in Coal Valley , a small coal - mining town in Western Canada which is located just south of Robb , Alberta . There , life is simple -- but often fraught with challenges . Elizabeth charms most everyone in Coal Valley , except Royal North West Mounted Police Constable Jack Thornton ( Daniel Lissing ) . He believes Thatcher 's wealthy father has doomed the lawman 's career by insisting he be assigned in town to protect the shipping magnate 's daughter . The town of Coal Valley was renamed Hope Valley in Episode 1 , Season 2 after the coal mine was closed . </P>", "<P> The film was released in the United States by Lionsgate on June 29 , 2018 and received mixed reviews from critics , who praised the performances of the cast , but called the direction and screenplay `` formulaic '' . </P>", "<P> The first day officially began at 5 : 07 p.m. with Richie Havens and featured folk artists . 32 acts performed during the sometimes rainy weekend in front of nearly half a million concertgoers . </P>", "<P> `` I Wanna Fall in Love '' is a song written by Buddy Brock and Mark Spiro , and recorded by American country music artist Lila McCann .

Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader send the Rebels false information that the station 's weapons systems are not operational in order to lure them into a trap . When the station 's protective shield is disabled by a ground assault team on the forest moon of the planet Endor ( led by Han Solo ) with the help of the native Ewoks , rebel fighters flew into the unfinished station targeting its reactor core chamber and damaged the reactor core itself , which eventually explodes and destroys the station . It was destroyed by Wedge Antilles and Lando Calrissian ( with Nien Nunb as his Millennium Falcon co-pilot ) , the former destroying a power regulator and the latter destroying the main reactor . </P>", "<P> Paul Bettany ( born 27 May 1971 ) is an English actor .

In 1220 , Aibak 's successor and son - in - law Shamsuddin Iltutmish completed a further three storeys . In 1369 , a lightning strike destroyed the top storey . Firoz Shah Tughlaq replaced the damaged storey , and added one more . Sher Shah Suri also added an entrance to this tower while he was ruling and Humayun was in exile . </P>", "<P> The United States is estimated to have a population of 327,589,916 as of April 23 , 2018 , making it the third most populous country in the world .

California and Texas are the most populous states , as the mean center of U.S. population has consistently shifted westward and southward . New York City is the most populous city in the United States . </P>", "<P> Ure played the backing track and guide vocals to the artists and then decided , as a way of getting all involved straightaway , to record the climax first . The artists were put in a huge group and sang the ' Feed the world , let them know it 's Christmas time ' refrain over and over again until it was complete . Having recorded the group , Ure chose Tony Hadley of Spandau Ballet to be the first singer into the studio to record his solo part . Hadley admitted that this had been nerve - wracking , knowing that all his contemporaries were watching him . One by one the other assigned singers then did likewise , with Ure taping their efforts and then making notes on which segments would be cut into the final recording . Le Bon , despite having already recorded his part at Ure 's house , re-recorded it so he could be part of the moment . Sting also recorded his words again , this time to provide harmony vocals . Despite being lead singers themselves , both Geldof and Ure had already decided that they would not sing any solo lines , although both took part in the ' feed the world ' finale . Ure later stated in his autobiography that he was constantly battling with Geldof , and telling him to leave when he would come into the production booth and wrongly tell the artist behind the microphone what to sing . </P>", "<P> The cause of women 's suffrage began in 1867 , Canadian Confederation year , when Dr. Emily Stowe came to Toronto to practise medicine . She was the first , and for many years the sole woman physician in Canada . Stowe , vitally interested in all matters relating to women , at once came before the public as a lecturer upon topics then somewhat new , `` Woman 's Sphere '' and `` Women in the Professions , '' being her subjects . She lectured not only in Toronto , but , under the auspices of various Mechanics ' Institutes , in Ottawa , Whitby , and Bradford . After attending a meeting of the American Society for the Advancement of Women , in Cleveland in 1877 , and meeting many women of the United States , Stowe , on returning home , felt that the time had arrived for some similar union among Canadian women . Talking it over with her friend , Helen Archibald , they decided that it would not be politic to attempt at once a suffrage association but , in November 1877 , organized what was known as `` The Toronto Woman 's Literary Club '' . </P>", "<P> Sarah Gilman was born on January 18 , 1996 and resides in Los Angeles .

In humans , less than a third of this enters the fetal ductus venosus and is carried to the inferior vena cava , while the rest enters the liver proper from the inferior border of the liver . The branch of the umbilical vein that supplies the right lobe of the liver first joins with the portal vein . The blood then moves to the right atrium of the heart . In the fetus , there is an opening between the right and left atrium ( the foramen ovale ) , and most of the blood flows through this hole directly into the left atrium from the right atrium , thus bypassing pulmonary circulation . The continuation of this blood flow is into the left ventricle , and from there it is pumped through the aorta into the body . Some of the blood moves from the aorta through the internal iliac arteries to the umbilical arteries , and re-enters the placenta , where carbon dioxide and other waste products from the fetus are taken up and enter the maternal circulation . </P>", "<P> Magma ( from Ancient Greek \u03bc\u03ac\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1 ( m\u00e1gma ) meaning `` thick unguent '' ) is a mixture of molten or semi-molten rock , volatiles and solids that is found beneath the surface of the Earth , and is expected to exist on other terrestrial planets and some natural satellites .

However , the Coriolis effect caused by the rotation of Earth causes winds to steer to the right of what would otherwise be expected across the Northern Hemisphere , and left of what would be expected in the Southern Hemisphere . This is why winds across the Northern Hemisphere tend to blow from the southwest , but they tend to be from the northwest in the Southern Hemisphere . When pressures are lower over the poles , the strength of the westerlies increases , which has the effect of warming the mid-latitudes . This occurs when the Arctic oscillation is positive , and during winter low pressure near the poles is stronger than it would be during the summer . When it is negative and pressures are higher over the poles , the flow is more meridional , blowing from the direction of the pole towards the equator , which brings cold air into the mid-latitudes . </P>", "<P> On April 20 , 2017 , Fox officially announced that The X-Files would be returning for an eleventh season of ten episodes , which would air in the 2017 -- 18 television season after filming in mid-2017 . </P>", "<Table> <Tr> <Th> Image </Th> <Th> Location </Th> <Th> Country </Th> <Th> Episode </Th> <Th> Setting </Th> <Th> Notes <P> </P> </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Ksar Hadada , Ghoumrassen </Td> <Td> Tunisia </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> Tatooine : Mos Espa slave quarters </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Ksar Ouled Soltane </Td> <Td> Tunisia </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> Tatooine : Mos Espa slave quarters </Td> <Td> 30 km south of Tataouine </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Onk Jemal , Tozeur 33 \u00b0 59 \u2032 39 '' N 7 \u00b0 50 \u2032 34 '' E \ufeff / \ufeff 33.994030 \u00b0 N 7.842748 \u00b0 E \ufeff / 33.994030 ; 7.842748 </Td> <Td> Tunisia </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> Tatooine : Mos Espa street set </Td> <Td> Location of the lightsaber duel between Qui - Gon Jinn & Darth Maul ; Mos Espa ; </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Palace of Caserta </Td> <Td> Italy </Td> <Td> I , II </Td> <Td> Naboo Royal Palace </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Whippendell Woods , Cassiobury Park , Watford </Td> <Td> UK </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> Naboo forest scene </Td> <Td> First meeting of Qui - Gon Jinn and Obi - Wan Kenobi with Jar Jar Binks . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Plaza de Espa\u00f1a in Seville </Td> <Td> Spain </Td> <Td> II </Td> <Td> Naboo : City of Theed </Td> <Td> <P> </P> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Villa del Balbianello </Td> <Td> Italy </Td> <Td> II </Td> <Td> Naboo lakeside </Td> <Td> Used for Anakin and Padm\u00e9 's wedding scene overlooking Lake Como </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Matmata </Td> <Td> Tunisia </Td> <Td> II , IV </Td> <Td> Tatooine : Lars Homestead </Td> <Td> Used for courtyard shots and Lars dinner scene .

In contrast , in the United Kingdom and Australia and in other parliamentary systems and elsewhere , the term two - party system is sometimes used to indicate an arrangement in which two major parties dominate elections but in which there are viable third parties which do win seats in the legislature , and in which the two major parties exert proportionately greater influence than their percentage of votes would suggest . </P>", "<P> `` Young , Wild & Free '' is a song by American rappers Snoop Dogg and Wiz Khalifa with American singer - songwriter Bruno Mars .

Basal species , such as plants , form the first level and are the resource limited species that feed on no other living creature in the web . Basal species can be autotrophs or detritivores , including `` decomposing organic material and its associated microorganisms which we defined as detritus , micro-inorganic material and associated microorganisms ( MIP ) , and vascular plant material . '' Most autotrophs capture the sun 's energy in chlorophyll , but some autotrophs ( the chemolithotrophs ) obtain energy by the chemical oxidation of inorganic compounds and can grow in dark environments , such as the sulfur bacterium Thiobacillus , which lives in hot sulfur springs . The top level has top ( or apex ) predators which no other species kills directly for its food resource needs . The intermediate levels are filled with omnivores that feed on more than one trophic level and cause energy to flow through a number of food pathways starting from a basal species . </P>", "<P> Before the 1930s , existing airports used a two - letter abbreviation based on the weather stations at the airports . At that time , `` LA '' served as the designation for Los Angeles Airport . But with the rapid growth in the aviation industry the designations expanded to three letters c. 1947 , and `` LA '' became `` LAX . '' The letter `` X '' has no specific meaning in this identifier . `` LAX '' is also used for the Port of Los Angeles in San Pedro and by Amtrak for Union Station in downtown Los Angeles . </P>", "<P> `` Somebody That I Used to Know '' is a song written by Belgian - Australian singer - songwriter Gotye , featuring New Zealand singer Kimbra .
